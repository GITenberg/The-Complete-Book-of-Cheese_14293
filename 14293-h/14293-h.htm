    <h2>I Remember Cheese</h2>

    <p>Cheese market day in a town in the north of Holland. All the
    cheese-fanciers are out, thumping the cannon-ball Edams and the
    millstone Goudas with their bare red knuckles, plugging in with
    a hollow steel tool for samples. In Holland the business of
    judging a crumb of cheese has been taken with great seriousness
    for centuries. The abracadabra is comparable to that of the
    wine-taster or tea-taster. These Edamers have the trained ear
    of music-masters and, merely by knuckle-rapping, can tell down
    to an air pocket left by a gas bubble just how mature the
    interior is.</p>

    <p>The connoisseurs use gingerbread as a mouth-freshener; and
    I, too, that sunny day among the Edams, kept my gingerbread
    handy and made my way from one fine cheese to another, trying
    out generous plugs from the heaped cannon balls that looked
    like the ammunition dump at Antietam.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 9 --><a name="Page_9"
       id="Page_9"></a> I remember another market day, this time in
       Lucerne. All morning I stocked up on good Schweizerk&auml;se
       and better Gruy&egrave;re. For lunch I had cheese salad. All
       around me the farmers were rolling two-hundred-pound
       Emmentalers, bigger than oxcart wheels. I sat in a little
       caf&eacute;, absorbing cheese and cheese lore in equal
       quantities. I learned that a prize cheese must be chock-full
       of equal-sized eyes, the gas holes produced during
       fermentation. They must glisten like polished bar glass. The
       cheese itself must be of a light, lemonish yellow. Its
       flavor must be nutlike. (Nuts and Swiss cheese complement
       each other as subtly as Gorgonzola and a ripe banana.) There
       are, I learned, "blind" Swiss cheeses as well, but the
       million-eyed ones are better.</p>

    <p>But I don't have to hark back to Switzerland and Holland for
    cheese memories. Here at home we have increasingly taken over
    the cheeses of all nations, first importing them, then
    imitating them, from Swiss Engadine to what we call Genuine
    Sprinz. We've naturalized Scandinavian Blues and smoked browns
    and baptized our own Saaland Pfarr in native whiskey. Of fifty
    popular Italian types we duplicate more than half, some fairly
    well, others badly.</p>

    <p>We have our own legitimate offspring too, beginning with the
    Pineapple, supposed to have been first made about 1845 in
    Litchfield County, Connecticut. We have our own creamy
    Neufch&acirc;tel, New York Coon, Vermont Sage, the delicious
    Liederkranz, California Jack, Nuworld, and dozens of others,
    not all quite so original.</p>

    <p>And, true to the American way, we've organized
    cheese-eating. There's an annual cheese week, and a cheese
    month (October). We even boast a mail-order Cheese-of-the-Month
    Club. We haven't yet reached the point of sophistication,
    however, attained by a Paris cheese club that meets regularly.
    To qualify for membership you have to identify two hundred
    basic cheeses, and you have to do it blindfolded.</p>

    <p>This is a test I'd prefer not to submit to, but in my
    amateur way I have during the past year or two been sharpening
    my <!-- Page 10 --><a name="Page_10"
       id="Page_10"></a>cheese perception with whatever varieties I
       could encounter around New York. I've run into briny
       Caucasian Cossack, Corsican Gricotta, and exotics like
       Rarush Durmar, Travnik, and Karaghi La-la. Cheese-hunting is
       one of the greatest&mdash;and least competitively
       crowded&mdash;of sports. I hope this book may lead others to
       give it a try.</p>

    <h2>The Big Cheese</h2>

    <p>One of the world's first outsize cheeses officially weighed
    in at four tons in a fair at Toronto, Canada, seventy years
    ago. Another monstrous Cheddar tipped the scales at six tons in
    the New York State Fair at Syracuse in 1937.</p>

    <p>Before this, a one-thousand-pounder was fetched all the way
    from New Zealand to London to star in the Wembley Exposition of
    1924. But, compared to the outsize Syracusan, it looked like a
    Baby Gouda. As a matter of fact, neither England nor any of her
    great dairying colonies have gone in for mammoth jobs, except
    Canada, with that four-tonner shown at Toronto.</p>

    <p>We should mention two historic king-size Chesters. You can
    find out all about them in <i>Cheddar Gorge,</i> edited by Sir
    John Squire. The first of them weighed 149 pounds, and was the
    largest made, up to the year 1825. It was proudly presented to
    H.R.H. the Duke of York. (Its heft almost tied the 147-pound
    Green <!-- Page 12 --><a name="Page_12"
       id="Page_12"></a>County wheel of Wisconsin Swiss presented
       by the makers to President Coolidge in 1928 in appreciation
       of his raising the protective tariff against genuine Swiss
       to 50 percent.) While the cheese itself weighed a mite under
       150, His Royal Highness, ruff, belly, knee breeches, doffed
       high hat and all, was a hundred-weight heavier, and thus
       almost dwarfed it.</p>

    <p>It was almost a century later that the second
    record-breaking Chester weighed in, at only 200 pounds. Yet it
    won a Gold Medal and a Challenge Cup and was presented to the
    King, who graciously accepted it. This was more than Queen
    Victoria had done with a bridal gift cheese that tipped the
    scales at 1,100 pounds. It took a whole day's yield from 780
    contented cows, and stood a foot and eight inches high,
    measuring nine feet, four inches around the middle. The
    assembled donors of the cheese were so proud of it that they
    asked royal permission to exhibit it on a round of country
    fairs. The Queen assented to this ambitious request, perhaps
    prompted by the exhibition-minded Albert. The publicity-seeking
    cheesemongers assured Her Majesty that the gift would be
    returned to her just as soon as it had been exhibited. But the
    Queen didn't want it back after it was show-worn. The donors
    began to quarrel among themselves about what to do with the
    remains, until finally it got into Chancery where so many lost
    causes end their days. The cheese was never heard of again.</p>

    <p>While it is generally true that the bigger the cheese the
    better, (much the same as a magnum bottle of champagne is
    better than a pint), there is a limit to the obesity of a
    block, ball or brick of almost any kinds of cheese. When they
    pass a certain limit, they lack homogeneity and are not nearly
    so good as the smaller ones. Today a good magnum size for an
    exhibition Cheddar is 560 pounds; for a prize Provolone, 280
    pounds; while a Swiss wheel of only 210 will draw crowds to any
    food-shop window.</p>

    <p>Yet by and large it's the monsters that get into the Cheese
    Hall of Fame and come down to us in song and story. For
    example, that four-ton Toronto affair inspired a cheese poet,
    James McIntyre, who doubled as the local undertaker.</p>

    <p>An ode to a one hundred percent American mammoth was
    inspired by "The Ultra-Democratic, Anti-Federalist Cheese of
    Cheshire." This was in the summer of 1801 when the patriotic
    people of Cheshire, Massachusetts, turned out en masse to
    concoct a mammoth cheese on the village green for presentation
    to their beloved President Jefferson. The unique demonstration
    occurred spontaneously in jubilant commemoration of the
    greatest political triumph of a new country in a new
    century&mdash;the victory of the Democrats over the
    Federalists. Its collective making was heralded in Boston's
    <i>Mercury and New England Palladium</i>, September 8,
    1801:</p>

    <p>This spirited achievement of early democracy is commemorated
    today by a sign set up at the ancient and honorable town of
    Cheshire, located between Pittsfield and North Adams, on Route
    8.</p>

    <p>Jefferson's speech of thanks to the democratic people of
    Cheshire rings out in history: "I look upon this cheese as a
    token of fidelity from the very heart of the people of this
    land to the great cause of equal rights to all men."</p>

    <p>This popular presentation started a tradition. When Van
    Buren succeeded to the Presidency, he received a similar
    mammoth <!-- Page 16 --><a name="Page_16"
       id="Page_16"></a>cheese in token of the high esteem in which
       he was held. A monstrous one, bigger than the Jeffersonian,
       was made by New Englanders to show their loyalty to
       President Jackson. For weeks this stood in state in the hall
       of the White House. At last the floor was a foot deep in the
       fragments remaining after the enthusiastic Democrats had
       eaten their fill.</p>

        <p>A giant Cantal, seeming to have been chopped open with
        an ax, stood aside of a golden-hued Chester and a Swiss
        Gruy&egrave;re resembling the wheel of a Roman chariot
        There were Dutch Edams, round and blood-red, and
        Port-Saluts lined up like soldiers on parade. Three Bries,
        side by side, suggested phases of the moon; two of them,
        very dry, were amber-colored and "full," and the third, in
        its second quarter, was runny and creamy, with a "milky
        way" which no human barrier seemed able to restrain. And
        all the while majestic Roqueforts looked down with princely

       id="Page_19"></a> May we nominate another dozen to form our
       own Cheese Hall of Fame? We begin our list with a partial
       roll call of the big Blues family and end it with members of
       the monastic order of Port-Salut Trappist that includes
       Canadian Oka and our own Kentucky thoroughbred.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>The Blues that Are Green</b></p>

    <p>Stilton, Roquefort and Gorgonzola form the triumvirate that
    rules a world of lesser Blues. They are actually green, as
    green as the mythical cheese the moon is made of.</p>

    <p>In almost every, land where cheese is made you can sample a
    handful of lesser Blues and imitations of the invincible three
    and try to classify them, until you're blue in the face. The
    best we can do in this slight summary is to mention a few of
    the most notable, aside from our own Blues of Minnesota,
    Wisconsin, Oregon and other states that major in cheese.</p>

    <p>Danish Blues are popular and splendidly made, such as
    "Flower of Denmark." The Argentine competes with a pampas-grass
    Blue all its own. But France and England are the leaders in
    this line, France first with a sort of triple triumvirate
    within a triumvirate&mdash;Septmoncel, Gex, and Sassenage, all
    three made with three milks mixed together: cow, goat and
    sheep. Septmoncel is the leader of these, made in the Jura
    mountains and considered by many French caseophiles to outrank
    Roquefort.</p>

    <p>This class of Blue or marbled cheese is called fromage
    persill&eacute;, as well as fromage bleu and pate bleue.
    Similar mountain cheeses are made in Auvergne and Aubrac and
    have distinct qualities that have brought them fame, such as
    Cantal, bleu d'Auvergne Guiole or Laguiole, bleu de Salers, and
    St. Flour. Olivet and Queville come within the color scheme,
    and sundry others such as Champol&eacute;on, Journiac, Queyras
    and Sarraz.</p>

    <p>Of English Blues there are several celebrities beside
    Stilton and Cheshire Stilton. Wensleydale was one in the early
    days, and still <!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a>is, together with Blue Dorset, the deepest
       green of them all, and esoteric Blue Vinny, a choosey cheese
       not liked by everybody, the favorite of Thomas Hardy.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Brie</b></p>

    <p>Sheila Hibben once wrote in <i>The New Yorker:</i></p>

    <p>I can't imagine any difference of opinion about Brie's being
    the queen of all cheeses, and if there is any such difference,
    I shall certainly ignore it. The very shape of Brie&mdash;so
    uncheese-like and so charmingly fragile&mdash;is exciting. Nine
    times out of ten a Brie will let you down&mdash;will be all
    caked into layers, which shows it is too young, or at the
    over-runny stage, which means it is too old&mdash;but when you
    come on the tenth Brie, <i>coulant</i> to just the right,
    delicate creaminess, and the color of fresh, sweet butter, no
    other cheese can compare with it.</p>

    <p>The season of Brie, like that of oysters, is simple to
    remember: only months with an "R," beginning with September,
    which is the best, bar none.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Caciocavallo</b></p>

    <p>From Bulgaria to Turkey the Italian "horse cheese," as
    Caciocavallo translates, is as universally popular as it is at
    home and in all the Little Italics throughout the rest of the
    world. Flattering imitations are made and named after it, as
    follows:</p>

    <p>A horse's head printed on the cheese gave rise to its
    popular name and to the myth that it is made of mare's milk. It
    is, however, curded from cow's milk, whole or partly skimmed,
    and sometimes from water buffalo; hard, yellow and so buttery
    that the best of it, which comes from Sorrento, is called
    <i>Cacio burro,</i> butter cheese. Slightly salty, with a spicy
    tang, it is eaten sliced when young and mild and used for
    grating and seasoning when old, not only on the usual Italian
    pastes but on sweets.</p>

    <p>Different from the many grating cheeses made from little
    balls of curd called <i>grana</i>, Caciocavallo is a <i>pasta
    fileta</i>, or drawn-curd product. Because of this it is
    sometimes drawn out in long thick threads and braided. It is a
    cheese for skilled artists to make sculptures with, sometimes
    horses' heads, again bunches of grapes and other fruits, even
    as Provolone is shaped like apples and pears and often worked
    into elaborate bas-relief designs. But ordinarily the horse's
    head is a plain tenpin in shape or a squat bottle with a knob
    on the side by which it has been tied up, two cheeses at a
    time, on opposite sides of a rafter, while being smoked lightly
    golden and rubbed with olive oil and butter to make it all the
    more buttery.</p>

    <p>In Calabria and Sicily it is very popular, and although the
    best comes from Sorrento, there is keen competition from
    Abruzzi, Apulian Province and Molise. It keeps well and doesn't
    spoil when shipped overseas.</p>

    <p>In his <i>Little Book of Cheese</i> Osbert Burdett
    recommends the high, horsy strength of this smoked Cacio over
    tobacco smoke after dinner:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Only monsters smoke at meals, but a monster assured me
        that Gorgonzola best survives this malpractice. Clearly,
        some pungency is necessary, and confidence suggests rather
        Cacio which would survive anything, the monster said.</p>

    <p><b>Camembert</b></p>

    <p>Camembert is called "mold-matured" and all that is genuine
    is labeled <i>Syndicat du Vrai Camembert</i>. The name in full
    is <i>Syndicat des Fabricants du Veritable Camembert de
    Normandie</i> and we agree that this is "a most useful
    association for the defense of one of the best cheeses of
    France." Its extremely delicate piquance cannot be matched,
    except perhaps by Brie.</p>

    <p>Napoleon is said to have named it and to have kissed the
    waitress who first served it to him in the tiny town of
    Camembert. And there a statue stands today in the market place
    to honor Marie Harel who made the first Camembert.</p>

    <p>Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple,
    pineapple, pear, French "flute" or pumpernickel. As-with Brie
    and with oysters, Camembert should be eaten only in the "R"
    months, and of these September is the best.</p>

    <p>Since Camembert rhymes with beware, if you can't get the
    <i>v&eacute;ritable</i> don't fall for a domestic imitation or
    any West German abomination such as one dressed like a
    valentine in a heart-shaped box and labeled
    "Camembert&mdash;Cheese Exquisite." They are equally tasteless,
    chalky with youth, or choking with ammoniacal gas when old and
    decrepit.</p>

    <p><b>Cheddar</b></p>

    <p>The English <i>Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</i>
    says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Cheddar cheese is one of the kings of cheese; it is pale
        coloured, mellow, salvy, and, when good, resembling a
        hazelnut in flavour. The Cheddar principle pervades the
        whole cheesemaking districts of America, Canada and New
        Zealand, but no cheese imported into England can equal the
        Cheddars of Somerset and the West of Scotland.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Named for a village near Bristol where farmer Joseph Harding
    first manufactured it, the best is still called Farmhouse
    Cheddar, <!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23"
       id="Page_23"></a>but in America we have practically none of
       this. Farmhouse Cheddar must be ripened at least nine months
       to a mellowness, and little of our American cheese gets as
       much as that. Back in 1695 John Houghton wrote that it
       "contended in goodness (if kept from two to five years,
       according to magnitude) with any cheese in England."</p>

    <p>Today it is called "England's second-best cheese," second
    after Stilton, of course.</p>

    <p>In early days a large cheese sufficed for a year or two of
    family feeding, according to this old note: "A big Cheddar can
    be kept for two years in excellent condition if kept in a cool
    room and turned over every other day."</p>

    <p>But in old England some were harder to preserve: "In Bath...
    I asked one lady of the larder how she kept Cheddar cheese. Her
    eyes twinkled: 'We don't keep cheese; we eats it.'"</p>

        and far too few people glorying in them. The Cheddar of the
        inn, of the chophouse, of the average English home, is a
        libel on a thing which, when authentic, is worthy of great
        honor. Cheshire, divinely commanded into existence as to
        three parts to precede and as to one part to accompany
        certain Tawny Ports and some Late-Bottled Ports, can be a
        thing for which the British Navy ought to fire a salute on
        the principle on which Colonel Brisson made his regiment
        salute when passing the great Burgundian vineyard.</p>

    <p>Cheshire is not only the most literary cheese in England,
    but the oldest. It was already manufactured when Caesar
    conquered Britain, and tradition is that the Romans built the
    walled city of Chester to control the district where the
    precious cheese was made. Chester on the River Dee was a
    stronghold against the Roman invasion.</p>

    <p>It came to fame with The Old Cheshire Cheese in Elizabethan
    times and waxed great with Samuel Johnson presiding at the
    Fleet Street Inn where White Cheshire was served "with radishes
    or watercress or celery when in season," and Red Cheshire was
    served toasted or stewed in a sort of Welsh Rabbit. (<i>See</i>
    <a href="#Page_50">Chapter 5</a>.)</p>

    <p>The Blue variety is called Cheshire-Stilton, and Vyvyan
    Holland, in <i>Cheddar Gorge</i> suggests that "it was no doubt
    a cheese of this sort, discovered and filched from the larder
    of the Queen of Hearts, that accounted for the contented grin
    on the face of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland."</p>

    <p>The crimson cannon balls of Holland have been heard around
    the world. Known as "red balls" in England and
    <i>katzenkopf,</i> "cat's head," in Germany, they differ from
    Gouda chiefly in the shape, Gouda being round but flattish and
    now chiefly imported as one-pound Baby Goudas.</p>

    <p>Edam when it is good is very, very good, but when it is bad
    it is horrid. Sophisticated ones are sent over already
    scalloped for the ultimate consumer to add port, and there are
    crocks of Holland cheese potted with sauterne. Both Edam and
    Gouda should be well aged to develop full-bodied quality, two
    years being the accepted standard for Edam.</p>

    <p>The best Edams result from a perfect combination of Breed
    (black-and-white Dutch Friesian) and Feed (the rich pasturage
    of Friesland and Noord Holland).</p>

    <p>The Goudas, shaped like English Derby and Belgian Delft and
    Leyden, come from South Holland. Some are specially made for
    the Jewish trade and called Kosher Gouda. Both Edam and Gouda
    are eaten at mealtimes thrice daily in Holland. A Dutch
    breakfast without one or the other on black bread with butter
    and black coffee would be unthinkable. They're also boon

    <p><b>Emmentaler, Gruy&egrave;re and Swiss</b></p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>When the working woman<br /></span> <span>Takes
            her midday lunch,<br /></span> <span>It is a piece of
            Gruy&egrave;re<br /></span> <span>Which for her takes

    <p>Whether an Emmentaler is eminently Schweizerk&auml;se, grand
    Gruy&egrave;re from France, or lesser Swiss of the United
    States, the shape, size and glisten of the eyes indicate the
    stage of ripeness, skill of making and quality of flavor. They
    must be uniform, roundish, about the size of a big cherry and,
    most important of all, must glisten like the eye of a lass in
    love, dry but with the suggestion of a tear.</p>

    <p>Gruy&egrave;re does not see eye to eye with the big-holed
    Swiss Saanen cartwheel or American imitation. It has tiny
    holes, and many of them; let us say it is freckled with
    pinholes, rather than pock-marked. This variety is technically
    called a <i>niszler</i>, while one without any holes at all is
    "blind." Eyes or holes are also called vesicles.</p>

    <p>Gruy&egrave;re Trauben (Grape Gruy&egrave;re) is aged in
    Neuch&acirc;tel wine in Switzerland, although most
    Gruy&egrave;re has been made in France since its introduction
    there in 1722. The most famous is made in the Jura, and another
    is called Comt&eacute; from its origin in
    Franche-Comt&eacute;.</p>

    <p>A blind Emmentaler was made in Switzerland for export to
    Italy where it was hardened in caves to become a grating cheese
    called Raper, and now it is largely imitated there. Emmentaler,
    in fact, because of its piquant pecan-nut flavor and inimitable
    quality, is simulated everywhere, even in Switzerland.</p>

    <p>Besides phonies from Argentina and countries as far off as
    Finland, we get a flood of imported and domestic Swisses of all
    sad sorts, with all possible faults&mdash;from too many holes,
    that make a flabby, wobbly cheese, to too few&mdash;cracked,
    dried-up, collapsed <!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27"
       id="Page_27"></a>or utterly ruined by molding inside. So it
       will pay you to buy only the kind already marked genuine in
       Switzerland. For there cheese such as Saanen takes six years
       to ripen, improves with age, and keeps forever.</p>

    <p>Cartwheels well over a hundred years old are still kept in
    cheese cellars (as common in Switzerland as wine cellars are in
    France), and it is said that the rank of a family is determined
    by the age and quality of the cheese in its larder.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Feta and Casere</b></p>

    <p>The Greeks have a name for it&mdash;Feta. Their neighbors
    call it Greek cheese. Feta is to cheese what Hymettus is to
    honey. The two together make ambrosial manna. Feta is soft and
    as blinding white as a plate of fresh Ricotta smothered with
    sour cream. The whiteness is preserved by shipping the cheese
    all the way from Greece in kegs sloshing full of milk, the milk
    being renewed from time to time. Having been cured in brine,
    this great sheep-milk curd is slightly salty and somewhat
    sharp, but superbly spicy.</p>

    <p>When first we tasted it fresh from the keg with salty milk
    dripping through our fingers, we gave it full marks. This was
    at the Staikos Brothers Greek-import store on West 23rd Street
    in Manhattan. We then compared Feta with thin wisps of its
    grown-up brother, Casere. This gray and greasy, hard and
    brittle palate-tickler of sheep's milk made us bleat for more
    Feta.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Gorgonzola</b></p>

    <p>Gorgonzola, least pretentious of the Blues triumvirate
    (including Roquefort and Stilton) is nonetheless by common
    consent monarch of all other Blues from Argentina to Denmark.
    In England, indeed, many epicures consider Gorgonzola greater
    than Stilton, which is the highest praise any cheese can get
    there. <!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a>Like all great cheeses it has been widely
       imitated, but never equaled. Imported Gorgonzola, when
       fruity ripe, is still firm but creamy and golden inside with
       rich green veins running through. Very pungent and highly
       flavored, it is eaten sliced or crumbled to flavor salad
       dressings, like Roquefort.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Habl&eacute; Cr&egrave;me Chantilly</b></p>

    <p>The name Habl&eacute; Cr&egrave;me Chantilly sounds French,
    but the cheese is Swedish and actually lives up to the blurb in
    the imported package: "The overall characteristic is
    indescribable and delightful freshness."</p>

    <p>This exclusive product of the Walk G&auml;rd Creamery was
    hailed by Sheila Hibben in <i>The New Yorker</i> of May 6,
    1950, as enthusiastically as Brillat-Savarin would have greeted
    a new dish, or the Planetarium a new star:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Endeavoring to be as restrained as I can, I shall merely
        suggest that the arrival of Cr&egrave;me Chantilly is a
        historic event and that in reporting on it I feel something
        of the responsibility that the contemporaries of Madame
        Harel, the famous cheese-making lady of Normandy, must have
        felt when they were passing judgment on the first
        Camembert.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Miss Hibben goes on to say that only a fromage &agrave; la
    cr&egrave;me made in Quebec had come anywhere near her
    impression of the new Swedish triumph. She quotes the last word
    from the makers themselves: "This is a very special product
    that has never been made on this earth before," and speaks of
    "the elusive flavor of mushrooms" before summing up, "the
    exquisitely textured curd and the unexpectedly fresh flavor
    combine to make it one of the most subtly enjoyable foods that
    have come my way in a long time."</p>

    <p>And so say we&mdash;all of us.</p>

    <p><b>Hand Cheese</b></p>

    <p>Hand cheese has this niche in our Cheese Hall of Fame not
    because we consider it great, but because it is usually
    included among the eighteen varieties on which the hundreds of
    others are based. It is named from having been molded into its
    final shape by hand. Universally popular with Germanic races,
    it is too strong for the others. To our mind, Hand cheese never
    had anything that Allg&auml;uer or Limburger hasn't improved
    upon.</p>

    <p>It is the only cheese that is commonly melted into steins of
    beer and drunk instead of eaten. It is usually studded with
    caraway seeds, the most natural spice for curds.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Limburger</b></p>

    <p>Limburger has always been popular in America, ever since it
    was brought over by German-American immigrants; but England
    never took to it. This is eloquently expressed in the following
    entry in the English <i>Encyclopedia of Practical
    Cookery</i>:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Limburger cheese is chiefly famous for its pungently
        offensive odor. It is made from skimmed milk, and allowed
        to partially decompose before pressing. It is very little
        known in this country, and might be less so with advantage
        to consumers.</p>
    </div>

    <p>But this is libel. Butter-soft and sapid, Limburger has
    brought gustatory pleasure to millions of hardy gastronomes
    since it came to light in the province of L&uuml;ttich in
    Belgium. It has been Americanized for almost a century and is
    by now one of the very few cheeses successfully imitated here,
    chiefly in New York and Wisconsin.</p>

    <p>Early Wisconsiners will never forget the Limburger Rebellion
    in Green County, when the people rose in protest against the
    Limburger caravan that was accustomed to park in the little
    town <!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30"
       id="Page_30"></a>of Monroe where it was marketed. They
       threatened to stage a modern Boston Tea Party and dump the
       odoriferous bricks in the river, when five or six wagonloads
       were left ripening in the sun in front of the town bank. The
       Limburger was finally stored safely underground.</p>

    <p>Like Limburger, this male cheese, often caraway-flavored,
    does not fare well in England. Although over here we consider
    M&uuml;nster far milder than Limburger, the English writer Eric
    Weir in <i>When Madame Cooks</i> will have none of it:</p>

    <p><!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31"
       id="Page_31"></a> I cannot think why this cheese was not
       thrown from the aeroplanes during the war to spread panic
       amongst enemy troops. It would have proved far more
       efficacious than those nasty deadly gases that kill people
       permanently.</p>

    grating. It is easy to believe that the so-called "Spanish
    cheese" used as a barricade by Americans in Nicaragua almost a
    century ago was none other than the almost indestructible
    Grana, as Parmesan is called in Italy.</p>

    <p>The association between cheese and battling began in B.C.
    days with the Jews and Romans, who fed cheese to their soldiers
    not only for its energy value but as a convenient form of
    rations, since every army travels on its stomach and can't go
    faster than its impedimenta. The last notable mention of cheese
    in war was the name of the <i>Monitor</i>: "A cheese box on a
    raft."</p>

    <p>Romano is not as expensive as Parmesan, although it is as
    friable, sharp and tangy for flavoring, especially for soups
    such as <!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32"
       id="Page_32"></a>onion and minestrone. It is brittle and
       just off-white when well aged.</p>

    <p>Although made of sheep's milk, Pecorino is classed with both
    Parmesan and Romano. All three are excellently imitated in
    Argentina. Romano and Pecorino Romano are interchangeable names
    for the strong, medium-sharp and piquant Parmesan types that
    sell for considerably less. Most of it is now shipped from
    Sardinia. There are several different kinds: Pecorino Dolce
    (sweet), Sardo Tuscano, and Pecorino Romano Cacio, which
    relates it to Caciocavallo.</p>

    <p>Kibitzers complain that some of the cheaper types of
    Pecorino are soapy, but fans give it high praise. Gillian F.,
    in her "Letter from Italy" in Osbert Burdett's delectable
    <i>Little Book of Cheese</i>, writes:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Out in the orchard, my companion, I don't remember how,
        had provided the miracle: a flask of wine, a loaf of bread
        and a slab of fresh Pecorino cheese (there wasn't any
        "thou" for either) ... But that cheese was Paradise; and
        the flask was emptied, and a wood dove cooing made you
        think that the flask's contents were in a crystal goblet
        instead of an enamel cup ... one only ... and the cheese
        broken with the fingers ... a cheese of cheeses.</p>
    </div>

    <p><b>Pont L'Ev&ecirc;que</b></p>

    <p>This semisoft, medium-strong, golden-tinted French classic
    made since the thirteenth century, is definitely a dessert
    cheese whose excellence is brought out best by a sound claret
    or tawny port.</p>

    <p><b>Port-Salut</b> (<i>See</i> <b>Trappist</b>)</p>

    <p><b>Provolone</b></p>

    <p>Within recent years Provolone has taken America by storm, as
    Camembert, Roquefort, Swiss, Limburger, Neufch&acirc;tel and
    such <!-- Page 33 --><a name="Page_33"
       id="Page_33"></a>great ones did long before. But it has not
       been successfully imitated here because the original is made
       of rich water-buffalo milk unattainable in the Americas.</p>

    <p>With Caciocavallo, this mellow, smoky flavorsome delight is
    put up in all sorts of artistic forms, red-cellophaned apples,
    pears, bells, a regular zoo of animals, and in all sorts of
    sizes, up to a monumental hundred-pound bas-relief imported for
    exhibition purposes by Phil Alpert.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Roquefort</b></p>

    <p>Homage to this <i>fromage!</i> Long hailed as <i>le roi</i>
    Roquefort, it has filled books and booklets beyond count. By
    the miracle of <i>Penicillium Roqueforti</i> a new cheese was
    made. It is placed historically back around the eighth century
    when Charlemagne was found picking out the green spots of
    Persill&eacute; with the point of his knife, thinking them
    decay. But the monks of Saint-Gall, who were his hosts,
    recorded in their annals that when they regaled him with
    Roquefort (because it was Friday and they had no fish) they
    also made bold to tell him he was wasting the best part of the
    cheese. So he tasted again, found the advice excellent and
    liked it so well he ordered two <i>caisses</i> of it sent every
    year to his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. He also suggested that
    it be cut in half first, to make sure it was well veined with
    blue, and then bound up with a wooden fastening.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he hoped the wood would protect the cheeses from
    mice and rats, for the good monks of Saint-Gall couldn't be
    expected to send an escort of cats from their chalky caves to
    guard them&mdash;even for Charlemagne. There is no telling how
    many cats were mustered out in the caves, in those early days,
    but a recent census put the number at five hundred. We can
    readily imagine the head handler in the caves leading a night
    inspection with a candle, followed by his chief taster and a
    regiment of cats. While the Dutch and other makers of cheese
    also employ cats to patrol <!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34"
       id="Page_34"></a>their storage caves, Roquefort holds the
       record for number. An interesting point in this connection
       is that as rats and mice pick only the prime cheeses, a
       gnawed one is not thrown away but greatly prized.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Sapsago, Schabziger or Swiss Green Cheese</b></p>

    <p>The name Sapsago is a corruption of Schabziger, German for
    whey cheese. It's a hay cheese, flavored heavily with melilot,
    a kind of clover that's also grown for hay. It comes from
    Switzerland in a hard, truncated cone wrapped in a piece of
    paper that says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To be used grated only<br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; Genuine Swiss Green Cheese<br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; Made of skimmed milk and herbs</p>

        <p>To the housewives! Do you want a change in your meals?
        Try the contents of this wrapper! Delicious as spreading
        mixed with butter, excellent for flavoring eggs, macaroni,
        spaghetti, potatoes, soup, etc. Can be used in place of any
        other cheese. <i>Do not take too much, you might spoil the
        flavor</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We put this wrapper among our papers, sealed it tight in an
    envelope, and to this day, six months later, the scent of
    Sapsago clings 'round it still.</p>

    <p><b>Stilton</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><i>Honor for Cheeses</i></p>

        <p>Literary and munching circles in London are putting
        quite a lot of thought into a proposed memorial to Stilton
        cheese. There is a Stilton Memorial Committee, with Sir
        John Squire at the head, and already the boys are
        fighting.</p>

        <p><!-- Page 35 --><a name="Page_35"
           id="Page_35"></a> One side, led by Sir John, is all for
           a monument.</p>

        <p>This, presumably, would not be a replica of Stilton
        itself, although Mr. Epstein could probably hack out a
        pretty effective cheese-shaped figure and call it
        "Dolorosa."</p>

        <p>The monument-boosters plan a figure of Mrs. Paulet, who
        first introduced Stilton to England. (Possibly a group
        showing Mrs. Paulet holding a young Stilton by the hand and
        introducing it, while the Stilton curtsies.)</p>

        <p>T.S. Eliot does not think that anyone would look at a
        monument, but wants to establish a Foundation for the
        Preservation of Ancient Cheeses. The practicability of this
        plan would depend largely on the site selected for the
        treasure house and the cost of obtaining a curator who
        could, or would, give his whole time to the work.</p>

        <p>Mr. J.A. Symonds, who is secretary of the committee,
        agrees with Mr. Eliot that a simple statue is not the best
        form.</p>

        <p>"I should like," he says, "something
        irrelevant&mdash;gargoyles, perhaps."</p>

        <p>I think that Mr. Symonds has hit on something there.</p>

        <p>I would suggest, if we Americans can pitch into this
        great movement, some gargoyles designed by Mr. Rube
        Goldberg.</p>

        <p>If the memorial could be devised so as to take on an
        international scope, an exchange fellowship might be
        established between England and America, although the
        exchange, in the case of Stilton, would have to be all on
        England's side.</p>

        <p>We might be allowed to furnish the money, however, while
        England furnishes the cheese.</p>

        <p>There is a very good precedent for such a bargain
        between the two countries.</p>

         <i>After 1903&mdash;What?</i></p>

    <p>When all seems lost in England there is still Stilton, an
    endless after-dinner conversation piece to which England points
    with pride. For a sound appreciation of this cheese see Clifton
    Fadiman's introduction to this book.</p>

    <p><b>Taleggio and Bel Paese</b></p>

    <p>When the great Italian cheese-maker, Galbini, first exported
    Bel Paese some years ago, it was an eloquent ambassador to
    America. But as the years went on and imitations were made in
    many lands, Galbini deemed it wise to set up his own factory in
    <i>our</i> beautiful country. However, the domestic Bel Paese
    and a minute one-pounder called Bel Paesino just didn't have
    that old Alpine zest. They were no better than the German copy
    called Sch&ouml;nland, after the original, or the French Fleur
    des Alpes.</p>

    <p>Mel Fino was a blend of Bel Paese and Gorgonzola. It perked
    up the market for a full, fruity cheese with snap. Then Galbini
    hit the jackpot with his Taleggio that fills the need for the
    sharpest, most sophisticated pungence of them all.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Trappist, Port-Salut, or Port du Salut, and Oka</b></p>

    <p>In spite of its name Trappist is no rat-trap commoner.
    Always of the elect, and better known as Port-Salut or Port du
    Salut from the original home of the Trappist monks in their
    chief French abbey, it is also set apart from the ordinary
    Canadians under the name of Oka, from the Trappist monastery
    there. It is made by Trappist monks all over the world,
    according to the original secret formula, and by Trappist
    Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani Trappist in
    Kentucky.</p>

    <p>This is a soft cheese, creamy and of superb flavor. You
    can't go wrong if you look for the monastery name stamped on,
    such as Harz&eacute; in Belgium, Mont-des-Cats in Flanders,
    Sainte Anne d'Auray in Brittany, and so forth.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, a commercial Port-Salut entirely without
    benefit of clergy or monastery is made in Milwaukee under the
    Lion Brand. It is one of the finest American cheeses in which
    we have ever sunk a fang.</p>

    <h2>Native Americans</h2>

    <p><b>American Cheddars</b></p>

    <p>The first American Cheddar was made soon after 1620 around
    Plymouth by Pilgrim fathers who brought along not only cheese
    from the homeland but a live cow to continue the supply. Proof
    of our ability to manufacture Cheddar of our own lies in the
    fact that by 1790 we were exporting it back to England.</p>

    <p>It was called Cheddar after the English original named for
    the village of Cheddar near Bristol. More than a century ago it
    made a new name for itself, Herkimer County cheese, from the
    section of New York State where it was first made best.
    Herkimer still equals its several distinguished competitors,
    Coon, Colorado Blackie, California Jack, Pineapple, Sage,
    Vermont Colby and Wisconsin Longhorn.</p>

    <p>The English called our imitation Yankee, or American,
    Cheddar, while <!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a> here at home it was popularly known as
       yellow or store cheese from its prominent position in every
       country store; also apple-pie cheese because of its affinity
       for the all-American dessert.</p>

    <p>The first Cheddar factory was founded by Jesse Williams in
    Rome, New York, just over a century ago and, with Herkimer
    County Cheddar already widely known, this established "New
    York" as the preferred "store-boughten" cheese.</p>

    <p>An account of New York's cheese business in the pioneer
    Wooden Nutmeg Era is found in Ernest Elmo Calkins' interesting
    book, <i>They Broke the Prairies</i>. A Yankee named Silvanus
    Ferris, "the most successful dairyman of Herkimer County," in
    the first decades of the 1800's teamed up with Robert Nesbit,
    "the old Quaker Cheese Buyer." They bought from farmers in the
    region and sold in New York City. And "according to the
    business ethics of the times," Nesbit went ahead to cheapen the
    cheese offered by deprecating its quality, hinting at a bad
    market and departing without buying. Later when Ferris arrived
    in a more optimistic mood, offering a slightly better price,
    the seller, unaware they were partners, and ignorant of the
    market price, snapped up the offer.</p>

    <p>Similar sharp-trade tactics put too much green cheese on the
    market, so those honestly aged from a minimum of eight months
    up to two years fetched higher prices. They were called "old,"
    such as Old Herkimer, Old Wisconsin Longhorn, and Old
    California Jack.</p>

    <p>Although the established Cheddar ages are three, fresh,
    medium-cured, and cured or aged, commercially they are divided
    into two and described as mild and sharp. The most popular are
    named for their states: Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, New York,
    Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin. Two New York Staters are called
    and named separately, Coon and Herkimer County. Tillamook goes
    by its own name with no mention of Oregon. Pineapple, Monterey
    Jack and Sage are seldom listed as Cheddars at all, although
    they are basically that.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 39 --><a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a> &nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Brick</b></p>

    <p>Brick is the one and only cheese for which the whole world
    gives America credit. Runners-up are Liederkranz, which rivals
    say is too close to Limburger, and Pineapple, which is only a
    Cheddar under its crisscrossed, painted and flavored rind. Yet
    Brick is no more distinguished than either of the hundred
    percent Americans, and in our opinion is less worth bragging
    about.</p>

    <p>It is a medium-firm, mild-to-strong slicing cheese for
    sandwiches and melting in hot dishes. Its texture is elastic
    but not rubbery, its taste sweetish, and it is full of little
    round holes or eyes. All this has inspired enthusiasts to liken
    it to Emmentaler. The most appropriate name for it has long
    been "married man's Limburger." To make up for the mildness
    caraway seed is sometimes added.</p>

    <p>About Civil War time, John Jossi, a dairyman of Dodge
    County, Wisconsin, came up with this novelty, a rennet cheese
    made of whole cow's milk. The curd is cut like Cheddar, heated,
    stirred and cooked firm to put in a brick-shaped box without a
    bottom and with slits in the sides to drain. When this is set
    on the draining table a couple of bricks are also laid on the
    cooked curd for pressure. It is this double use of bricks, for
    shaping and for pressing, that has led to the confusion about
    which came first in originating the name.</p>

    <p>The formed "bricks" of cheese are rubbed with salt for three
    days and they ripen slowly, taking up to two months.</p>

    <p>We eat several million pounds a year and 95 percent of that
    comes from Wisconsin, with a trickle from New York.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Colorado Blackie Cheese</b></p>

    <p>A subtly different American Cheddar is putting Colorado on
    our cheese map. It is called Blackie from the black-waxed rind
    and it resembles Vermont State cheese, although it is flatter.
    This <!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a>is a proud new American product, proving
       that although Papa Cheddar was born in England his American
       kinfolk have developed independent and valuable characters
       all on their own.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Coon Cheese</b></p>

    <p>Coon cheese is full of flavor from being aged on shelves at
    a higher temperature than cold storage. Its rind is darker from
    the growth of mold and this shade is sometimes painted on more
    ordinary Cheddars to make them look like Coon, which always
    brings a 10 percent premium above the general run.</p>

    <p>Made at Lowville, New York, it has received high praise from
    a host of admirers, among them the French cook, Clementine, in
    Phineas Beck's <i>Kitchen</i>, who raised it to the par of
    French immortals by calling it Fromage de Coon. Clementine used
    it "with scintillating success in countless French recipes
    which ended with the words <i>gratiner au four et servir tres
    chaud</i>. She made <i>baguettes</i> of it by soaking sticks
    three-eights-inch square and one and a half inches long in
    lukewarm milk, rolling them in flour, beaten egg and bread
    crumbs and browning them instantaneously in boiling oil."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Herkimer County Cheese</b></p>

    <p>The standard method for making American Cheddar was
    established in Herkimer County, New York, in 1841 and has been
    rigidly maintained down to this day. Made with rennet and a
    bacterial "starter," the curd is cut and pressed to squeeze out
    all of the whey and then aged in cylindrical forms for a year
    or more.</p>

    <p>Herkimer leads the whole breed by being flaky, brittle,
    sharp and nutty, with a crumb that will crumble, and a soft,
    mouth-watering pale orange color when it is properly aged.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a> &nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Isigny</b></p>

    <p>Isigny is a native American cheese that came a cropper. It
    seems to be extinct now, and perhaps that is all to the good,
    for it never meant to be anything more than another Camembert,
    of which we have plenty of imitation.</p>

    <p>Not long after the Civil War the attempt was made to perfect
    Isigny. The curd was carefully prepared according to an
    original formula, washed and rubbed and set aside to come of
    age. But when it did, alas, it was more like Limburger than
    Camembert, and since good domestic Limburger was then a dime a
    pound, obviously it wouldn't pay off. Yet in shape the newborn
    resembled Camembert, although it was much larger. So they cut
    it down and named it after the delicate French Creme
    d'lsigny.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Jack, California Jack and Monterey Jack</b></p>

    <p>Jack was first known as Monterey cheese from the California
    county where it originated. Then it was called Jack for short,
    and only now takes its full name after sixty years of
    popularity on the West Coast. Because it is little known in the
    East and has to be shipped so far, it commands the top Cheddar
    price.</p>

    <p>Monterey Jack is a stirred curd Cheddar without any annatto
    coloring. It is sweeter than most and milder when young, but it
    gets sharper with age and more expensive because of storage
    costs.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Liederkranz</b></p>

    <p>No native American cheese has been so widely ballyhooed, and
    so deservedly, as Liederkranz, which translates "Wreath of
    Song."</p>

    <p>Back in the gay, inventive nineties, Emil Frey, a young
    delicatessen <!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a> keeper in New York, tried to please some
       bereft customers by making an imitation of Bismarck
       Schlossk&auml;se. This was imperative because the imported
       German cheese didn't stand up during the long sea trip and
       Emil's customers, mostly members of the famous Liederkranz
       singing society, didn't feel like singing without it. But
       Emil's attempts at imitation only added indigestion to their
       dejection, until one day&mdash;<i>fabelhaft!</i> One of
       those cheese dream castles in Spain came true. He turned out
       a tawny, altogether golden, tangy and mellow little marvel
       that actually was an improvement on Bismarck's old
       Schlossk&auml;se. Better than Brick, it was a deodorized
       Limburger, both a man's cheese and one that cheese-conscious
       women adored.</p>

    <p>Emil named it "Wreath of Song" for the Liederkranz
    customers. It soon became as internationally known as tabasco
    from Texas or Parisian Camembert which it slightly resembles.
    Borden's bought out Frey in 1929 and they enjoy telling the
    story of a G.I. who, to celebrate V-E Day in Paris, sent to his
    family in Indiana, only a few miles from the factory at Van
    Wert, Ohio, a whole case of what he had learned was "the finest
    cheese France could make." And when the family opened it, there
    was Liederkranz.</p>

    <p>Another deserved distinction is that of being sandwiched in
    between two foreign immortals in the following recipe:</p>

        Camembert and Liederkranz, you can leave it on, scrape any
        thick part off, or remove it all. Mash the soft creams
        together with the Roquefort, butter and flour, using a
        silver fork. Put the mix into

           metal surface will turn the cheese black in cooking.</p>

        <p>Stir in the cream and keep stirring until you have a
        smooth, creamy sauce. Strain through sieve or cheesecloth,
        and mix in the olives and pimiento thoroughly. Sprinkle
        well with cayenne and put into a pot to mellow for a few
        days, or much longer.</p>

    <p>The name <i>Schnitzelbank</i> comes from "school bench," a
    game. This snappy-sweet pot is specially suited to a beer party
    and stein songs. It is also the affinity-spread with rye and
    pumpernickel, and may be served in small sandwiches or on
    crackers, celery and such, to make appetizing tidbits for
    cocktails, tea, or cider.</p>

    <p>Like the trinity of cheeses that make it, the mixture is
    eaten best at room temperature, when its flavor is fullest. If
    kept in the refrigerator, it should be taken out a couple of
    hours before serving. Since it is a natural cheese mixture,
    which has gone through no process or doping with preservative,
    it will not keep more than two weeks. This mellow-sharp mix is
    the sort of ideal the factory processors shoot at with their
    olive-pimiento abominations. Once you've potted your own,
    you'll find it gives the same thrill as garnishing your own
    Liptauer.</p>

    <p><b>Minnesota Blue</b></p>

    <p>The discovery of sandstone caves in the bluffs along the
    Mississippi, in and near the Twin Cities of Minnesota, has
    established a distinctive type of Blue cheese named for the
    state. Although the Roquefort process of France is followed and
    the cheese is inoculated in the same way by mold from bread, it
    can never equal the genuine imported, marked with its red-sheep
    brand, because the milk used in Minnesota Blue is cow's milk,
    and the caves are sandstone instead of limestone. Yet this is
    an excellent, Blue cheese in its own right.</p>

    <p><b>Pineapple</b></p>

    <p>Pineapple cheese is named after its shape rather than its
    flavor, although there are rumors that some pineapple flavor is
    noticeable near the oiled rind. This flavor does not penetrate
    through to the Cheddar center. Many makers of processed cheese
    have tampered with the original, so today you can't be sure of
    anything except getting a smaller size every year or two, at a
    higher price. Originally six pounds, the Pineapple has shrunk
    to nearly six ounces. The proper bright-orange, oiled and
    shellacked surface is more apt to be a sickly lemon.</p>

    <p>Always an ornamental cheese, it once stood in state on the
    side-board under a silver bell also made to represent a
    pineapple. You cut a top slice off the cheese, just as you
    would off the fruit, and there was a rose-colored,
    fine-tasting, mellow-hard cheese to spoon out with a special
    silver cheese spoon or scoop. Between meals the silver top was
    put on the silver holder and the oiled and shellacked rind kept
    the cheese moist. Even when the Pineapple was eaten down to the
    rind the shell served as a dunking bowl to fill with some
    salubrious cold Fondue or salad.</p>

    <p>Made in the same manner as Cheddar with the curd cooked
    harder, Pineapple's distinction lies in being hung in a net
    that makes diamond-shaped corrugations on the surface,
    simulating the sections of the fruit. It is a pioneer American
    product with almost a century and a half of service since Lewis
    M. Norton conceived it in 1808 in Litchfield County,
    Connecticut. There in 1845 he built a factory and made a
    deserved fortune out of his decorative ingenuity with what
    before had been plain, unromantic yellow or store cheese.</p>

    <p>Perhaps his inspiration came from cone-shaped Cheshire in
    old England, also called Pineapple cheese, combined with the
    hanging up of Provolones in Italy that leaves the looser
    pattern of the four sustaining strings.</p>

    <p><b>Sage, Vermont Sage and Vermont State</b></p>

    <p>The story of Sage cheese, or green cheese as it was called
    originally, shows the several phases most cheeses have gone
    through, from their simple, honest beginnings to
    commercialization, and sometimes back to the real thing.</p>

    <p>The English <i>Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</i> has an
    early Sage recipe:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>This is a species of cream cheese made by adding sage
        leaves and greening to the milk. A very good receipt for it
        is given thus: Bruise the tops of fresh young red sage
        leaves with an equal quantity of spinach leaves and squeeze
        out the juice. Add this to the extract of rennet and stir
        into the milk as much as your taste may deem sufficient.
        Break the curd when it comes, salt it, fill the vat high
        with it, press for a few hours, and then turn the cheese
        every day.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Fancy Cheese in America, lay</i> Charles A. Publow,
    records the commercialization of the cheese mentioned above, a
    century or two later, in 1910:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Sage cheese is another modified form of the Cheddar
        variety. Its distinguishing features are a mottled green
        color and a sage flavor. The usual method of manufacture is
        as follows: One-third of the total amount of milk is placed
        in a vat by itself and colored green by the addition of
        eight to twelve ounces of commercial sage color to each
        1,000 pounds of milk. If green corn leaves (unavailable in
        England) or other substances are used for coloring, the
        amounts will vary accordingly. The milk is then made up by
        the regular Cheddar method, as is also the remaining
        two-thirds, in a separate vat. At the time of removing the
        whey the green and white curds are mixed. Some prefer,
        however, to mix the curds at the time of milling, as a more
        distinct color is secured. After milling, the sage extract
        flavoring is sprayed over the curd with an atomizer. The
        curd is then <!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46"
           id="Page_46"></a>salted and pressed into the regular
           Cheddar shapes and sizes.</p>

        <p>A very satisfactory Sage cheese is made at the New York
        State College of Agriculture by simply dropping green
        coloring, made from the leaves of corn and spinach, upon
        the curd, after milling. An even green mottling is thus
        easily secured without additional labor. Sage flavoring
        extract is sprayed over the curd by an atomizer. One-half
        ounce of flavoring is usually sufficient for a hundred
        pounds of curd and can be secured from dairy supply
        houses.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A modern cheese authority reported on the current (1953)
    method:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Instead of sage leaves, or tea prepared from them, at
        present the cheese is flavored with oil of Dalmatian wild
        sage because it has the sharpest flavor. This piny oil,
        thujone, is diluted with water, 250 parts to one, and
        either added to the milk or sprayed over the curds,
        one-eighth ounce for 500 quarts of milk.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In scouting around for a possible maker of the real thing
    today, we wrote to Vrest Orton of Vermont, and got this
    reply:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Sage cheese is one of the really indigenous and best
        native Vermont products. So far as I know, there is only
        one factory making it and that is my friend, George
        Crowley's. He makes a limited amount for my Vermont Country
        Store. It is the fine old-time full cream cheese, flavored
        with real sage.</p>

        <p>On this hangs a tale. Some years ago I couldn't get
        enough sage cheese (we never can) so I asked a Wisconsin
        cheesemaker if he would make some. Said he would but
        couldn't at that time&mdash;because the alfalfa wasn't
        ripe. I said, "What in hell has alfalfa got to do with sage
        cheese?" He said, "Well, we flavor the sage cheese with a
        synthetic sage flavor and then throw in some pieces of
        chopped-up alfalfa to make it look green."</p>

        <p>So I said to hell with that and the next time I saw
        George Crowley I told him the story and George said, "We
        don't use synthetic flavor, alfalfa or anything like
        that."</p>

        <p>"<!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47"
           id="Page_47"></a> Then what do you use, George?" I
           inquired.</p>

        <p>"We use real sage."</p>

        <p>"Why?"</p>

        <p>"Well, because it's cheaper than that synthetic
        stuff."</p>
    </div>

    <p>The genuine Vermont Sage arrived. Here are our notes on
    it:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Oh, wilderness were Paradise enow! My taste buds come to
        full flower with the Sage. There's a slight burned savor
        recalling smoked cheese, although not related in any way.
        Mildly resinous like that Near East one packed in pine,
        suggesting the well-saged dressing of a turkey. A round
        mouthful of luscious mellowness, with a bouquet&mdash;a
        snapping reminder to the nose. And there's just a
        soup&ccedil;on of new-mown hay above the green freckles of
        herb to delight the eye and set the fancy free. So this is
        the <i>v&eacute;ritable vert</i>, green cheese&mdash;the
        moon is made of it! <i>Vert v&eacute;ritable.</i> A general
        favorite with everybody who ever tasted it, for generations
        of lusty crumblers.</p>
    </div>

    <p><b>Old-Fashioned Vermont State Store Cheese</b></p>

    <p>We received from savant Vrest Orton another letter, together
    with some Vermont store cheese and some crackers.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>This cheese is our regular old-fashioned store
        cheese&mdash;it's been in old country stores for
        generations and we have been pioneers in spreading the word
        about it. It is, of course, a natural aged cheese, no
        processing, no fussing, no fooling with it. It's made the
        same way it was back in 1870, by the old-time Colby method
        which makes a cheese which is not so dry as Cheddar and
        also has holes in it, something like Swiss. Also, it ages
        faster.</p>

        <p>Did you know that during the last part of the nineteenth
        century and part of the twentieth, Vermont was the leading
        cheesemaking state in the Union? When I was a lad, every
        town in Vermont had one or more cheese factories. Now there
        are only two left&mdash;not counting any that make process.
        Process isn't cheese!</p>

        <p><!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48"
           id="Page_48"></a> The crackers are the old-time store
           cracker&mdash;every Vermonter used to buy a big barrel
           once a year to set in the buttery and eat. A classic
           dish is crackers, broken up in a bowl of cold milk, with
           a hunk of Vermont cheese like this on the side. Grand
           snack, grand midnight supper, grand anything. These
           crackers are not sweet, not salt, and as such make a
           good base for anything&mdash;swell with clam chowder,
           also with toasted cheese....</p>

    <p><b>Tillamook</b></p>

    <p>It takes two pocket-sized, but thick, yellow volumes to
    record the story of Oregon's great Tillamook. <i>The Cheddar
    Box</i>, by Dean Collins, comes neatly boxed and bound in
    golden cloth stamped with a purple title, like the rind of a
    real Tillamook. Volume I is entitled <i>Cheese Cheddar</i>, and
    Volume II is a two-pound Cheddar cheese labeled Tillamook and
    molded to fit inside its book jacket. We borrowed Volume I from
    a noted <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, and never could get him to
    come across with Volume II. We guessed its fate, however, from
    a note on the flyleaf of the only tome available: "This is an
    excellent cheese, full cream and medium sharp, and a unique set
    of books in which Volume II suggests Bacon's: 'Some books are
    to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed
    and digested.'"</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Wisconsin Longhorn</b></p>

    <p>Since we began this chapter with all-American Cheddars, it
    is only fitting to end with Wisconsin Longhorn, a sort of
    national standard, even though it's not nearly so fancy or
    high-priced as some of the regional natives that can't approach
    its enormous output. It's one of those all-purpose round
    cheeses that even taste round in your mouth. We are specially
    partial to it.</p>

    <p>Most Cheddars are named after their states. Yet, putting all
    of <!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49"
       id="Page_49"></a>these thirty-seven states together, they
       produce only about half as much as Wisconsin alone.</p>

    <p>Besides Longhorn, in Wisconsin there are a dozen regional
    competitors ranging from White Twin Cheddar, to which no
    annatto coloring has been added, through Green Bay cheese to
    Wisconsin Redskin and Martha Washington Aged, proudly set forth
    by P.H. Kasper of Bear Creek, who is said to have "won more
    prizes in forty years than any ten cheesemakers put
    together."</p>

    <p>To help guarantee a market for all this excellent apple-pie
    cheese, the Wisconsin State Legislature made a law about it,
    recognizing the truth of Eugene Field's jingle:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>Apple pie without cheese<br /></span> <span>Is
            like a kiss without a squeeze.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Small matter in the Badger State when the affinity is made
    legal and the couple lawfully wedded in Statute No. 160,065.
    It's still in force:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><i>Butter and cheese to be served.</i> Every person,
        firm or corporation duly licensed to operate a hotel or
        restaurant shall serve with each meal for which a charge of
        twenty-five cents or more is made, at least two-thirds of
        an ounce of Wisconsin butter and two-thirds of an ounce of
        Wisconsin cheese.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Besides Longhorn, Wisconsin leads in Limburger. It produces
    so much Swiss that the state is sometimes called
    Swissconsin.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>That nice little smoky room at the "Salutation," which
        is even now continually presenting itself to my
        recollection, with all its associated train of pipes,
        egg-hot, welsh-rabbits, metaphysics and poetry.</p>

        <p class="author">Charles Lamb,<br />
         IN A LETTER TO COLERIDGE</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unlike the beginning of the classical Jugged Hare recipe:
    "First catch your hare!" we modern Rabbit-hunters start off
    with "First catch your Cheddar!" And some of us go so far as to
    smuggle in formerly forbidden <i>fromages</i> such as
    Gruy&egrave;re, Neufch&acirc;tel, Parmesan, and mixtures
    thereof. We run the gamut <!-- Page 51 --><a name="Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a> of personal preferences in selecting the
       Rabbit cheese itself, from old-time American, yellow or
       store cheese, to Coon and Canadian-smoked, though all of it
       is still Cheddar, no matter how you slice it.</p>

    <p>Then, too, guests are made to run the gauntlet of
    all-American trimmings from pin-money pickles to peanut butter,
    succotash and maybe marshmallows; we add mustard, chill, curry,
    tabasco and sundry bottled red devils from the grocery store,
    to add pep and piquance to the traditional cayenne and black
    pepper. This results in Rabbits that are out of focus, out of
    order and out of this world.</p>

    <p>Among modern sins of omission, the Worcestershire sauce is
    left out by braggarts who aver that they can take it or leave
    it. And, in these degenerate days, when it comes to
    substitutions for the original beer or stale pale ale, we find
    the gratings of great Cheddars wet down with mere California
    sherry or even ginger ale&mdash;yet so far, thank goodness, no
    Cokes. And there's tomato juice out of a can into the Rum Turn
    Tiddy, and sometimes celery soup in place of milk or cream.</p>

    <p>In view of all this, we can only look to the standard
    cookbooks for salvation. These are mostly compiled by women,
    our thoughtful mothers, wives and sweethearts who have saved
    the twin Basic Rabbits for us. If it weren't for these Fanny
    Farmers, the making of a real aboriginal Welsh Rabbit would be
    a lost art&mdash;lost in sporting male attempts to improve upon
    the original.</p>

    <p>The girls are still polite about the whole thing and
    protectively pervert the original spelling of "Rabbit" to
    "Rarebit" in their culinary guides. We have heard that once a
    club of ladies in high society tried to high-pressure the
    publishers of Mr. Webster's dictionary to change the old
    spelling in their favor. Yet there is a lot to be said for this
    more genteel and appetizing rendering of the word, for the
    Welsh masterpiece is, after all, a very rare bit of
    cheesemongery, male or female.</p>

    <p>Yet in dealing with "Rarebits" the distaff side seldom sets
    down more than the basic Adam and Eve in a whole Paradise of
    Rabbits: No. 1, <!-- Page 52 --><a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a> the wild male type made with beer, and No.
       2, the mild female made with milk. Yet now that the chafing
       dish has come back to stay, there's a flurry in the Rabbit
       warren and the new cooking encyclopedias give up to a dozen
       variants. Actually there are easily half a gross of valid
       ones in current esteem.</p>

    <p>The two basic recipes are differentiated by the liquid
    ingredient, but both the beer and the milk are used only one
    way&mdash;warm, or anyway at room temperature. And again for
    the two, there is but one traditional cheese&mdash;Cheddar,
    ripe, old or merely aged from six months onward. This is also
    called American, store, sharp, Rabbit, yellow, beer, Wisconsin
    Longhorn, mouse, and even rat.</p>

    <p>The seasoned, sapid Cheddar-type, so indispensable, includes
    dozens of varieties under different names, regional or
    commercial. These are easily identified as
    sisters-under-the-rinds by all five senses:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><b>sight:</b> Golden yellow and mellow to the eye. It's
        one of those round cheeses that also tastes round in the
        mouth.</p>

        <p><b>hearing:</b> By thumping, a cheese-fancier, like a
        melon-picker, can tell if a Cheddar is rich, ripe and ready
        for the Rabbit. When you hear your dealer say, "It's six
        months old or more," enough said.</p>

        <p><b>smell:</b> A scent as fresh as that of the daisies
        and herbs the mother milk cow munched "will hang round it
        still." Also a slight beery savor.</p>

        <p><b>touch:</b> Crumbly&mdash;a caress to the fingers.</p>

        <p><b>taste:</b> The quintessence of this fivefold test.
        Just cuddle a crumb with your tongue and if it tickles the
        taste buds it's prime. When it melts in your mouth, that's
        proof it will melt in the pan.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Beyond all this (and in spite of the school that plumps for
    the No. 2 temperance alternative) we must point out that beer
    has a <!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a>special affinity for Cheddar. The French
       have clearly established this in their names for Welsh
       Rabbit, <i>Fromage Fondue &agrave; la Bi&egrave;re</i> and
       <i>Fondue &agrave; l'Anglaise</i>.</p>

    <p>To prepare such a cheese for the pan, each Rabbit hound may
    have a preference all his own, for here the question comes up
    of how it melts best. Do you shave, slice, dice, shred, mince,
    chop, cut, scrape or crumble it in the fingers? This will vary
    according to one's temperament and the condition of the cheese.
    Generally, for best results it is coarsely grated. When it
    comes to making all this into a rare bit of Rabbit there
    is:</p>

    <p><b>The One and Only Method</b></p>

    <p>Use a double boiler, or preferably a chafing dish, avoiding
    aluminum and other soft metals. Heat the upper pan by simmering
    water in the lower one, but don't let the water boil up or
    touch the top pan.</p>

    <p>Most, but not all, Rabbits are begun by heating a bit of
    butter or margarine in the pan in which one cup of roughly
    grated cheese, usually sharp Cheddar, is melted and mixed with
    one-half cup of liquid, added gradually. (The butter isn't
    necessary for a cheese that should melt by itself.)</p>

    <p>The two principal ingredients are melted smoothly together
    and kept from curdling by stirring steadily in one direction
    only, over an even heat. The spoon used should be of hard wood,
    sterling silver or porcelain. Never use tin, aluminum or soft
    metal&mdash;the taste may come off to taint the job.</p>

    <p>Be sure the liquid is at room temperature, or warmer, and
    add it gradually, without interrupting the stirring. Do not let
    it come to the bubbling point, and never let it boil.</p>

    <p>Add seasonings only when the cheese is melted, which will
    take two or three minutes. Then continue to stir in the same
    direction without an instant's letup, for maybe ten minutes or
    more, until the Rabbit is smooth. The consistency and velvety
    <!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54"
       id="Page_54"></a>smoothness depend a good deal on whether or
       not an egg, or a beaten yolk, is added.</p>

    <p>The hotter the Rabbit is served, the better. You can sizzle
    the top with a salamander or other branding iron, but in any
    case set it forth as nearly sizzling as possible, on toast
    hellishly hot, whether it's browned or buttered on one side or
    both.</p>

    <p>Give a thought to the sad case of the "little dog whose name
    was Rover, and when he was dead he was dead all over."
    Something very similar happens with a Rabbit that's allowed to
    cool down&mdash;when it's cold it's cold all over, and you
    can't resuscitate it by heating.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>2 tablespoons butter<br />
         3 cups grated old Cheddar<br />
         &frac12; teaspoon English dry mustard<br />
         &frac12; teaspoon salt<br />
         A dash of cayenne<br />
         1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br />
         2 egg yolks, lightly beaten with<br />
         &frac12; cup light beer or ale<br />
         4 slices hot buttered toast</p>

        <p>Over boiling water melt butter and cheese together,
        stirring steadily with a wooden (or other tasteless) spoon
        in one direction only. Add seasonings and do not interrupt
        your rhythmic stirring, as you pour in a bit at a time of
        the beer-and-egg mixture until it's all used up.</p>

        <p>It may take many minutes of constant stirring to achieve
        the essential creamy thickness and then some more to slick
        it out as smooth as velvet.</p>

        <p>Keep it piping hot but don't let it bubble, for a boiled
        Rabbit is a spoiled Rabbit. Only unremitting stirring (and
        the best of cheese) will keep it from curdling, getting
        stringy or rubbery. <!-- Page 55 --><a name="Page_55"
           id="Page_55"></a> Pour the Rabbit generously over crisp,
           freshly buttered toast and serve instantly on hot
           plates.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Usually crusts are cut off the bread before toasting, and
    some aesthetes toast one side only, spreading the toasted side
    with cold butter for taste contrast. Lay the toast on the hot
    plate, buttered side down, and pour the Rabbit over the porous
    untoasted side so it can soak in. (This is recommended in Lady
    Llanover's recipe, which appears on page 52 of this book.)</p>

    <p>Although the original bread for Rabbit toast was white,
    there is now no limit in choice among whole wheat, graham,
    rolls, muffins, buns, croutons and crackers, to infinity.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>For a rich milk Rabbit use &frac12; cup thin cream,
        evaporated milk,<br />
         whole milk or buttermilk, instead of beer as in No. 1.
        Then, to<br />
         keep everything bland, cut down the mustard by half or
        leave<br />
         it out, and use paprika in place of cayenne. As in No. 1,
        the<br />
         use of Worcestershire sauce is optional, although our
        feeling is<br />
         that any spirited Rabbit would resent its being left
        out.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Either of these basic recipes can be made without eggs, and
    more cheaply, although the beaten egg is a guarantee against
    stringiness. When the egg is missing, we are sad to record that
    a teaspoon or so of cornstarch generally takes its place.</p>

    <p>Rabbiteers are of two minds about fast and slow heating and
    stirring, so you'll have to adjust that to your own experience
    and rhythm. As a rule, the heat is reduced when the cheese is
    almost melted, and speed of stirring slows when the eggs and
    last ingredients go in.</p>

    <p>Many moderns who have found that monosodium glutamate steps
    up the flavor of natural cheese, put it in at the start, using
    one-half teaspoon for each cup of grated Cheddar. When it comes
    to pepper you are fancy-free. As both black and white
    <!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56"
       id="Page_56"></a>pepper are now held in almost equal esteem,
       you might equip your hutch with twin hand-mills to do the
       grinding fresh, for this is always worth the trouble.
       Tabasco sauce is little used and needs a cautious hand, but
       some addicts can't leave it out any more than they can swear
       off the Worcestershire.</p>

    <p>The school that plumps for malty Rabbits and the other that
    goes for milky ones are equally emphatic in their choice. So
    let us consider the compromise of our old friend Frederick
    Philip Stieff, the Baltimore <i>homme de bouche</i>, as he set
    it forth for us years ago in <i>10,000 Snacks</i>: "The idea of
    cooking a Rabbit with beer is an exploded and dangerous theory.
    Tap your keg or open your case of ale or beer and serve
    <i>with</i>, not in your Rabbit."</p>

        beverages</i>)</p>

        <p>2 cups grated sharp cheese<br />
         3 heaping tablespoons butter<br />
         1&frac12; cups milk<br />
         4 eggs<br />
         1 heaping tablespoon mustard<br />
         2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br />
         Pepper, salt and paprika to taste&mdash;then add more of
        each.</p>

        <p>Grease well with butter the interior of your double
        boiler so that no hard particles of cheese will form in the
        mixture later and contribute undesirable lumps.</p>

        <p>Put cheese, well-grated, into the double boiler and add
        butter and milk. From this point vigorous stirring should
        be indulged in until Rabbit is ready for serving.</p>

        <p>Prepare a mixture of Worcestershire sauce, mustard,
        pepper, salt and paprika. These should be beaten until
        light and then slowly poured into the double boiler.
        Nothing now remains to be done except to stir and cook down
        to proper consistency over a fairly slow flame. The finale
        has not arrived until you can drip the rabbit from the
        spoon and spell the word <i>finis</i> on the surface.

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Cut a slice of the real Welsh cheese made of sheep's and
        cow's milk; toast it at the fire on both sides, but not so
        much as to drop (melt). Toast on one side a piece of bread
        less than &frac14; inch thick, to be quite crisp, and
        spread it very thinly with fresh, cold butter on the
        toasted side. (It must not be saturated.) Lay the toasted
        cheese upon the untoasted bread side and serve immediately
        on a very hot plate. The butter on the toast can, of
        course, be omitted. (It is more frequently eaten without
        butter.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>From this original toasting of the cheese many Englishmen
    still call Welsh Rabbit "Toasted Cheese," but Lady Llanover
    goes on to point out that the Toasted Rabbit of her Wales and
    the Melted or Stewed Buck Rabbit of England (which has become
    our American standard) are as different in the making as the
    regional cheeses used in them, and she says that while doctors
    prescribed the toasted Welsh as salubrious for invalids, the
    stewed cheese of Olde England was "only adapted to strong
    digestions."</p>

    <p>English literature rings with praise for the toasted cheese
    of Wales and England. There is Christopher North's eloquent
    "threads of unbeaten gold, shining like gossamer filaments
    (that may be pulled from its tough and tenacious
    substance)."</p>

    <p>Yet not all of the references are complimentary.</p>

    rudenesses:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><i>The Welsh Enter Heaven</i></p>

        <p>The Lord had been complaining to St. Peter of the dearth
        of good singers in Heaven. "Yet," He said testily, "I hear
        excellent singing outside the walls. Why are not those
        singers here with me?"</p>

        <p>St. Peter said, "They are the Welsh. They refuse to come
        in; they say they are happy enough outside, playing with a
        ball and boxing and singing such songs as '<i>Suspan
        Fach</i>'"</p>

        <p>The Lord said, "I wish them to come in here to sing Bach
        and Mendelssohn. See that they are in before sundown."</p>

        <p>St. Peter went to the Welsh and gave them the commands
        of the Lord. But still they shook their heads. Harassed,
        St. Peter went to consult with St. David, who, with a
        smile, was reading the works of Caradoc Evans.</p>

        <p>St. David said, "Try toasted cheese. Build a fire just
        inside the gates and get a few angels to toast cheese in
        front of it" This St. Peter did. The heavenly aroma of the
        sizzling, browning cheese was wafted over the walls and,
        with loud shouts, a great concourse of the Welsh came
        sprinting in. When sufficient were inside to make up a male
        voice choir of a hundred, St Peter slammed the gates.
        However, it is said that these are the only Welsh in
        Heaven.</p>

    <p>An elaboration of the simple Welsh original went English
    with Dr. William Maginn, the London journalist whose facile pen
    enlivened the <i>Blackwoods Magazine</i> era with <i>Ten

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Much is to be said in favor of toasted cheese for
        supper. It is the cant to say that Welsh rabbit is heavy
        eating. I like it best in the genuine Welsh way,
        however&mdash;that is, the toasted bread buttered on both
        sides profusely, then a layer of cold roast beef with
        mustard and horseradish, and then, on the top of all, the
        superstratum, of Cheshire <i>thoroughly</i> saturated,
        while, in the process of toasting, with genuine porter,
        black pepper, and shallot vinegar. I peril myself upon the
        assertion that this is not a heavy supper for a man who has
        been busy all day till dinner in reading, writing, walking
        or riding&mdash;who has occupied himself between dinner and
        supper in the discussion of a bottle or two of sound wine,
        or any equivalent&mdash;and who proposes to swallow at
        least three tumblers of something hot ere he resigns
        himself to the embrace of Somnus. With these provisos, I
        recommend toasted cheese for supper.</p>
    </div>

    <p><!-- Page 60 --><a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60"></a> The popularity of this has come down to us
       in the succinct summing-up, "Toasted cheese hath no
       master."</p>

    <p>The Welsh original became simple after Dr. Maginn's supper
    sandwich was served, a century and a half ago; for it was
    served as a savory to sum up and help digest a dinner, in this
    form:</p>

        <p>Remove all crusts from bread slices, toast on both sides
        and soak to saturation in hot beer. Melt thin slices of
        sharp old cheese in butter in an iron skillet, with an
        added spot of beer and dry English mustard. Stir steadily
        with a wooden spoon and, when velvety, serve a-sizzle on
        piping hot beer-soaked toast.</p>
    </div>

    <p>While toasted cheese undoubtedly was the Number One dairy
    dish of Anglo-Saxons, stewed cheese came along to rival it in
    Elizabethan London. This sophisticated, big-city dish, also
    called a Buck Rabbit, was the making of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
    on Fleet Street, where Dr. Johnson later presided. And it must
    have been the pick of the town back in the days when barrooms
    still had sawdust on the floor, for the learned Doctor endorsed
    old Omar Khayyam's love of the pub with: "There is nothing
    which has been contrived by man by which so much happiness is
    produced as by a good tavern." Yet he was no gourmet, as may be
    judged by his likening of a succulent, golden-fried oyster to
    "a baby's ear dropped in sawdust."</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is just as well that no description of the
    world's first Golden Buck has come down from him. But we don't
    have to look far for on-the-spot pen pictures by other men of
    letters at "The Cheese," as it was affectionately called. To a
    man they sang praises for that piping hot dish of preserved and
    beatified milk.</p>

    <p>Inspired by stewed cheese, Mark Lemon, the leading rhymester
    of <i>Punch</i>, wrote the following poem and dedicated it to
    the memory of Lovelace:</p>

    <div class="poem">

    </div>

    <p>All that's necessary is an old-time "cheese stewer" or a
    reasonable substitute. The base of this is what was once
    quaintly called a "hot-water bath." This was a sort of
    miniature wash boiler just big enough to fit in snugly half a
    dozen individual tins, made squarish and standing high enough
    above the bath water to keep any of it from getting into the
    stew. In these tins the cheese is melted. But since such a
    tinsmith's contraption is hard to come by in these days of
    fireproof cooking glass, we suggest muffin tins, ramekins or
    even small cups to crowd into the bottom of your double boiler
    or chafing dish. But beyond this we plump for a revival of the
    "cheese stewer" in stainless steel, silver or glass.</p>

    <p>In the ritual at "The Cheese," these dishes, brimming over,
    "bubbling and blistering with the stew," followed a pudding
    that's still famous. Although down the centuries the recipe has
    been kept secret, the identifiable ingredients have been
    itemized as follows: "Tender steak, savory oyster, seductive
    kidney, fascinating lark, rich gravy, ardent pepper and
    delicate paste"&mdash;not to mention mushrooms. And after the
    second or third helping of pudding, with a pint of stout,
    bitter, or the mildest and mellowest brown October Ale in a
    dented pewter pot, "the stewed Cheshire cheese."</p>

    <p>Cheese was the one and only other course prescribed by
    tradition and appetite from the time when Charles II aled and
    regaled Nell Gwyn at "The Cheese," where Shakespeare is said to
    have sampled this "kind of a glorified Welsh Rarebit, served
    piping hot in the square shallow tins in which it is cooked and
    garnished with sippets of delicately colored toast."</p>

    <p><!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a> Among early records is this report of
       Addison's in <i>The Spectator</i> of September 25,1711:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>They yawn for a Cheshire cheese, and begin about
        midnight, when the whole company is disposed to be drowsy.
        He that yawns widest, and at the same time so naturally as
        to produce the most yawns amongst his spectators, carries
        home the cheese.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Only a short time later, in 1725, the proprietor of
    Simpson's in the Strand inaugurated a daily guessing contest
    that drew crowds to his fashionable eating and drinking place.
    He would set forth a huge portion of cheese and wager champagne
    and cigars for the house that no one present could correctly
    estimate the weight, height and girth of it.</p>

    <p>As late as 1795, when Boswell was accompanying Dr. Johnson
    to "The Cheese," records of St. Dunstan's Club, which also met
    there, showed that the current price of a Buck Rabbit was
    tuppence, and that this was also the amount of the usual
    tip.</p>

    <p>This creamy Stewed Buck, on which the literary greats of
    Johnson's time supped while they smoked their church wardens,
    received its highest praise from an American newspaper woman
    who rhapsodized in 1891: "Then came stewed cheese, on the thin
    shaving of crisp, golden toast in hot silver saucers&mdash;so
    hot that the cheese was the substance of thick cream, the
    flavor of purple pansies and red raspberries commingled."</p>

    <p>This may seem a bit flowery, but in truth many fine cheeses
    hold a trace of the bouquet of the flowers that have enriched
    the milk. Alpine blooms and herbs haunt the Gruy&egrave;re,
    Parmesan wafts the scent of Parma violets, the Flower Cheese of
    England is perfumed with the petals of rose, violet, marigold
    and jasmine.</p>

        <p>This German deviation is made exactly the same as the

        melted in the skillet is also stirred up with brunette
        beer.</p>

    <p>Since beer is a kind of liquid bread, it is natural for the
    two to commingle in Rabbits whether they are blond Dutch or

    the Cheddar is noted for its beery smell, there is further
    affinity here. An old English proverb sums it up neatly: "Bread
    and cheese are the two targets against death."</p>

    <p>By the way, the word pumpernickel is said to have been

    <p>Although wine Rabbits, red or white, are as unusual as Swiss
    ones with Gruy&egrave;re in place of Cheddar, wine is commonly
    drunk with anything from a Golden Buck to a Blushing Bunny. But
    for most of us, a deep draught of beer or ale goes best with an
    even deeper draught of the mellow scent of a Cheddar
    golden-yellow.</p>

    <h2>The Fondue</h2>

    <p>There is a conspiracy among the dictionary makers to take
    the heart out of the Fondue. Webster makes it seem no better
    than a collapsed souffl&eacute;, with his definition:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><b>Fondue.</b> Also, erroneously, <i>fondu</i>. A dish
        made of melted cheese, butter, eggs, and, often, milk and
        bread crumbs.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Thorndike-Barnhart further demotes this dish, that for
    centuries has been one of the world's greatest, to "a
    combination of melted cheese, eggs and butter" and explains
    that the name comes from the French <i>fondre</i>, meaning
    melt. The latest snub is delivered by the up-to-date <i>Cook's
    Quiz</i> compiled by TV culinary experts:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>A baked dish with eggs, cheese, butter, milk and bread
        crumbs.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A baked dish, indeed! Yet the Fondue has added to the gaiety
    <!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a>and inebriety of nations, if not of
       dictionaries. It has commanded the respect of the culinary
       great. Savarin, Boulestin, Andr&eacute; Simon, all have
       hailed its heavenly consistency, all have been regaled with
       its creamy, nay velvety, smoothness.</p>

    <p>A touch of garlic, a dash of kirsch, fresh ground black
    pepper, nutmeg, black pearl truffles of Bugey, red cayenne
    pepper, the luscious gravy of roast turkey&mdash;such little
    matters help to make an authentic dunking Fondue, not a baked
    Fondue, mind you. Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin a century and a
    half ago brought the original "receipt" with him and spread it
    around with characteristic generosity during the two years of
    his exile in New York after the French Revolution. In his
    monumental <i>Physiologie du Go&ucirc;t</i> he records an
    incident that occurred in 1795:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Whilst passing through Boston ... I taught the
        restaurant-keeper Julien to make a <i>Fondue</i>, or eggs
        cooked with cheese. This dish, a novelty to the Americans,
        became so much the rage, that he (Julien) felt himself
        obliged, by way of thanks, to send me to New York the rump
        of one of those pretty little roebucks that are brought
        from Canada in winter, and which was declared exquisite by
        the chosen committee whom I convoked for the occasion.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As the great French gourmet, Savarin was born on the Swiss
    border (at Belley, in the fertile Province of Bugey, where
    Gertrude Stein later had a summer home), he no doubt ate
    Gruy&egrave;re three times a day, as is the custom in
    Switzerland and adjacent parts. He sets down the recipe just as
    he got it from its Swiss source, the papers of Monsieur
    Trolliet, in the neighboring Canton of Berne:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Take as many eggs as you wish to use, according to the
        number of your guests. Then take a lump of good
        Gruy&egrave;re cheese, weighing about a third of the eggs,
        and a nut of butter about half the weight of the cheese.
        (Since today's eggs in America weigh about 1&frac12; ounces
        apiece, if you start the Fondue with 8.
        <!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86"
           id="Page_86"></a>your lump of good Gruy&egrave;re would
           come to &frac14; pound and your butter to &#8539;
           pound.)</p>

        <p>Break and beat the eggs well in a flat pan, then add the
        butter and the cheese, grated or cut in small pieces.</p>

        <p>Place the pan on a good fire and stir with a wooden
        spoon until the mixture is fairly thick and soft; put in a
        little or no salt, according to the age of the cheese, and
        a good deal of pepper, for this is one of the special
        attributes of this ancient dish.</p>

        <p>Let it be placed on the table in a hot dish, and if some
        of the best wines be produced, and the bottle passed quite
        freely, a marvelous effect will be beheld.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This has long been quoted as the proper way to make the
    national dish of Switzerland. Savarin tells of hearing oldsters
    in his district laugh over the Bishop of Belley eating his
    Fondue with a spoon instead of the traditional fork, in the
    first decade of the 1700's. He tells, too, of a Fondue party he
    threw for a couple of his septuagenarian cousins in Paris
    "about the year 1801."</p>

    <p>The party was the result of much friendly taunting of the
    master: "By Jove, Jean, you have been bragging for such a long
    time about your Fondues, you have continually made our mouths
    water. It is high time to put a stop to all this. We will come
    and breakfast with you some day and see what sort of thing this
    dish is."</p>

    <p>Savarin invited them for ten o'clock next day, started them
    off with the table laid on a "snow white cloth, and in each
    one's place two dozen oysters with a bright golden lemon. At
    each end of the table stood a bottle of sauterne, carefully
    wiped, excepting the cork, which showed distinctly that it had
    been in the cellar for a long while.... After the oysters,
    which were quite fresh, came some broiled kidneys, a
    <i>terrine</i> of <i>foie gras</i>, a pie with truffles, and
    finally the Fondue. The different ingredients had all been
    assembled in a stewpan, which was placed on the table over a
    chafing dish, heated with spirits of wine.</p>

    <p>"Then," Savarin is quoted, "I commenced operations on the
    field of battle, and my cousins did not lose a single one of
    <!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a>my movements. They were loud in the praise
       of this preparation, and asked me to let them have the
       receipt, which I promised them...."</p>

    <p>This Fondue breakfast party that gave the nineteenth century
    such a good start was polished off with "fruits in season and
    sweets, a cup of genuine mocha, ... and finally two sorts of
    liqueurs, one a spirit for cleansing, and the other an oil for
    softening."</p>

    <p>This primitive Swiss Cheese Fondue is now prepared more
    elaborately in what is called:</p>

    <p><img src="images/pointer.gif"
         width="58"
         height="41"
         alt="picture: pointer" /> <b>Neufch&acirc;tel
         Style</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>2&frac12; cups grated imported Swiss<br />
         1&frac12; tablespoons flour<br />
         1 clove of garlic<br />
         1 cup dry white wine<br />
         Crusty French "flute" or hard rolls cut into big
        mouthfuls, handy<br />
         <span style="margin-left: 2em;">for dunking</span><br />
         1 jigger kirsch<br />
         Salt<br />
         Pepper<br />
         Nutmeg</p>

        <p>The cheese should be shredded or grated coarsely and
        mixed well with the flour. Use a chafing dish for cooking
        and a small heated casserole for serving. Hub the bottom
        and sides of the blazer well with garlic, pour in the wine
        and heat to bubbling, just under boiling. Add cheese
        slowly, half a cup at a time, and stir steadily in one
        direction only, as in making Welsh Rabbit. Use a silver
        fork. Season with very little salt, always depending on how
        salty the cheese is, but use plenty of black pepper,
        freshly ground, and a touch of nutmeg. Then pour in the
        kirsch, stir steadily and invite guests to dunk their
        forked bread in the dish or in a smaller preheated
        casserole over a low electric or alcohol burner on the
        dining table. The trick is to keep the bubbling melted
        cheese in rhythmic motion with the fork, both up and down
        and around and around.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The dunkers stab the hunks of crusty French bread through
    the soft part to secure a firm hold in the crust, for if your
    bread <!-- Page 88 --><a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a>comes off in dunking you pay a forfeit,
       often a bottle of wine.</p>

    <p>The dunking is done as rhythmically as the stirring, guests
    taking regular turns at twirling the fork to keep the cheese
    swirling. When this "chafing dish cheese custard," as it has
    been called in England, is ready for eating, each in turn
    thrusts in his fork, sops up a mouthful with the bread for a
    sponge and gives the Fondue a final stir, to keep it always
    moving in the same direction. All the while the heat beneath
    the dish keeps it gently bubbling.</p>

    <p>Such a Neufch&acirc;tel party was a favorite of King Edward
    VII, especially when he was stepping out as the Prince of
    Wales. He was as fond of Fondue as most of the great gourmets
    of his day and preferred it to Welsh Rabbit, perhaps because of
    the wine and kirsch that went into it.</p>

    <p>At such a party a little heated wine is added if the Fondue
    gets too thick. When finally it has cooked down to a crust in
    the bottom of the dish, this is forked out by the host and
    divided among the guests as a very special dividend.</p>

    <p>Any dry white wine will serve in a pinch, and the
    Switzerland Cheese Association, in broadcasting this classical
    recipe, points out that any dry rum, slivovitz, or brandy,
    including applejack, will be a valid substitute for the kirsch.
    To us, applejack seems specially suited, when we stop to
    consider our native taste that has married apple pie to cheese
    since pioneer times.</p>

    <p>In culinary usage fondue means "melting to an edible
    consistency" and this, of course, doesn't refer to cheese
    alone, although we use it chiefly for that.</p>

    <p>In France Fondue is also the common name for a simple dish
    of eggs scrambled with grated cheese and butter and served very
    hot on toasted bread, or filled into fancy paper cases, quickly
    browned on top and served at once. The reason for this is that
    all baked Fondues fall as easily and as far as Souffl&eacute;s,
    although the latter are more noted for this failing. There is a
    similarity in the soft fluffiness of both, although the Fondues
    are always more moist. For there is a stiff, stuffed-shirt
    buildup around any Souffl&eacute;,
    <!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89"
       id="Page_89"></a>suggesting a dressy dinner, while Fondue
       started as a self-service dunking bowl.</p>

    <p>Our modern tendency is to try to make over the original
    French Fondue on the Welsh Rabbit model&mdash;to turn it into a
    sort of French Rabbit. Although we know that both
    Gruy&egrave;re and Emmentaler are what we call Swiss and that
    it is impossible in America to duplicate the rich Alpine flavor
    given by the mountain herbs, we are inclined to try all sorts
    of domestic cheeses and mixtures thereof. But it's best to
    stick to Savarin's "lump of Gruy&egrave;re" just as the
    neighboring French and Italians do. It is interesting to note
    that this Swiss Alpine cooking has become so international that
    it is credited to Italy in the following description we reprint
    from <i>When Madame Cooks</i>, by an Englishman, Eric Weir:</p>

         l'Italienne</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>This is one of those egg dishes that makes one feel
        really grateful to hens. From its name it originated
        probably in Italy, but it has crossed the Alps. I have
        often met it in France, but only once in Italy.</p>

        <p>First of all, make a very stiff white sauce with butter,
        flour and milk. The sauce should be stiff enough to allow
        the wooden spoon to stand upright or almost.</p>

        <p>Off the fire, add yolks of eggs and 4 ounces of grated
        Gruy&egrave;re cheese. Mix this in well with the white
        sauce and season with salt, pepper and some grated nutmeg.
        Beat whites of egg firm. Add the whites to the preparation,
        stir in, and pour into a pudding basin.</p>

        <p>Take a large saucepan and fill half full of water. Bring
        to a boil, and then place the pudding basin so that the top
        of the basin is well out of the water. Allow to boil gently
        for 1&frac12; to 2 hours. Renew the boiling water from time
        to time, as it evaporates, and take care that the water, in
        boiling, does not bubble over the mixture.</p>

        <p>Test with a knife, as for a cake, to see if it is
        cooked. When <!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90"
           id="Page_90"></a> the knife comes out clean, take the
           basin out of the water and turn the Fondue out on a
           dish. It should be fairly firm and keep the shape of the
           basin.</p>

        <p>Sprinkle with some finely chopped ham and serve hot.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The imported Swiss sometimes is cubed instead of grated,
    then marinated for four or five hours in dry white wine, before
    being melted and liquored with the schnapps. This can be
    pleasantly adopted here in:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>1 pound imported Swiss cheese, cubed<br />
         &frac34; cup scuppernong or other American white
        wine<br />
         1&frac12; jiggers applejack</p>

        <p>After marinating the Swiss cubes in the wine, simply
        melt together over hot water, stir until soft and creamy,
        add the applejack and dunk with fingers of toast or your
        own to a chorus of "All Bound Round with a Woolen
        String."</p>

        <p>Of course, this can be treated as a mere vinous Welsh
        Rabbit and poured over toast, to be accompanied by beer.
        But wine is the thing, for the French Fondue is to dry wine
        what the Rabbit is to stale ale or fresh beer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We say French instead of Swiss because the French took over
    the dish so eagerly, together with the great Gruy&egrave;re
    that makes it distinctive. They internationalized it, sent it
    around the world with bouillabaisse and onion soup, that
    celestial <i>soupe &agrave; l'oignon</i> on which snowy showers
    of grated Gruy&egrave;re descend.</p>

    <p>To put the Welsh Rabbit in its place they called it Fondue
    &agrave; l'Anglaise, which also points up the twinlike
    relationship of the world's two favorite dishes of melted
    cheese. But to differentiate and show they are not identical
    twins, the No. 1 dish remained Fromage Fondue while the second
    was baptized Fromage Fondue &agrave; la Bi&egrave;re.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a> Beginning with Savarin the French whisked
       up more rapturous, rhapsodic writing about Gruy&egrave;re
       and its offspring, the Fondue, together with the puffed
       Souffl&eacute;, than about any other imported cheese except
       Parmesan.</p>

    <p>Parmesan and Gruy&egrave;re were praised as the two greatest
    culinary cheeses. A variant Fondue was made of the Italian
    cheese.</p>

        finely grated, and wine in small splashes. Stir steadily,
        in one direction only, until velvety. Season sharply with
        the contrasting peppers and serve over fingers of
        toast.</p>
    </div>

    <p><!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a> This is also nice when served bubbling in
       individual, preheated pastry shells, casseroles or ramekins,
       although this way most of the fun of the dunking party is
       left out. To make up for it, however, cooked slices of
       mushrooms are sometimes added.</p>

    <p>At the Cheese Cellar in the New York World's Fair Swiss
    Pavilion, where a continual dunking party was in progress,
    thousands of amateurs learned such basic things as not to
    overcook the Fondue lest it become stringy, and the protocol of
    dunking in turn and keeping the mass in continual motion until
    the next on the Fondue line dips in his cube of bread. The
    success of the dish depends on making it quickly, keeping it
    gently a-bubble and never letting it stand still for a split
    second.</p>

    <p>The Swiss, who consume three or four times as much cheese
    per capita as we, and almost twice as much as the French, are
    willing to share Fondue honors with the French Alpine province
    of Savoy, a natural cheese cellar with almost two dozen
    distinctive types of its very own, such as Fat cheese, also
    called Death's Head; La Grande Bornand, a luscious half-dried
    sheep's milker; Chevrotins, small, dry goat milk cheeses; and
    Le Vacherin. The latter, made in both Savoy and Switzerland,
    boasts two interesting variants:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>1. <i>Vacherin Fondue or Spiced Fondue:</i> Made about
        the same as Emmentaler, ripened to sharp age, and then
        melted, spices added and the cheese re-formed. It is also
        called Spiced Fondue and sells for about two dollars a
        pound. Named Fondue from being melted, though it's really
        recooked,</p>

        <p>2. <i>Vacherin &agrave; la Main:</i> This is a curiosity
        in cheeses, resembling a cold, uncooked Fondue. Made of
        cow's milk, it is round, a foot in diameter and half a foot
        high. It is salted and aged until the rind is hard and the
        inside more runny than the ripest Camembert, so it can be
        eaten with a spoon (like the cooked Fondue) as well as
        spread on bread. The local name for it is <i>Tome de
        Montagne</i>.</p>

    <p>Although Savarin's dunking Fondue was first to make a
    sensation on these shores and is still in highest esteem among
    epicures, the Fondue America took to its bosom was baked. The
    original recipe came from the super-caseous province of Savoy
    under the explicit title, <i>La Fondue au Fromage</i>.</p>

        yolks of eggs and Gruy&egrave;re, in thin slices for a
        change. Use red pepper instead of black, splash in a jigger
        of kirsch but no white wine. Finally fold in the egg whites
        and bake in a mold for 45 minutes.</p>

    <p>We adapted this to our national taste which had already
    based the whole business of melted cheese on the Welsh Rabbit

    with this:</p>

    <h2>Souffl&eacute;s, Puffs and Ramekins</h2>

    <p>There isn't much difference between Cheese Souffl&eacute;s,
    Puffs and Ramekins. The <i>English Encyclopedia of Practical
    Cookery</i>, the oldest, biggest and best of such works in
    English, lumps Cheese Puffs and Ramekins together, giving the
    same recipes for both, although it treats each extensively
    under its own name when not made with cheese.</p>

    <p>Cheese was the basis of the original French Ramequin, cheese
    and bread crumbs or puff paste, baked in a mold, (with puff
    again the principal factor in Souffl&eacute;, from the French
    <i>souffler</i>, puff up).</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>3 tablespoons butter or margarine<br />
         4 tablespoons flour<br />
         1&frac14; cups hot milk, scalded<br />
         1 teaspoon salt<br />
         A dash of cayenne<br />
         &frac12; cup grated Cheddar cheese, sharp<br />
         2 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow<br />
         2 egg whites, beaten stiff</p>

        <p>Melt butter, stir in flour and milk gradually until
        thick and smooth. Season and add the cheese, continuing the
        cooking and slow stirring until velvety. Remove from heat
        and let cool somewhat; then stir in the egg yolks with a
        light hand and an upward motion. Fold in the stiff whites
        and when evenly mixed pour into a big, round baking dish.
        (Some butter it and some don't.) To make sure the top will
        be even when baked, run a spoon or knife around the
        surface, about 1 inch from the edge of the dish, before
        baking slowly in a moderate oven until puffed high and
        beautifully browned. Serve instantly for fear the
        Souffl&eacute; may fall. The baking takes up to an hour and
        the egg whites shouldn't be beaten so stiff they are hard
        to fold in and contain no air to expand and puff up the
        dish.</p>
    </div>

    <p>To perk up the seasonings, mustard, Worcestershire sauce,
    lemon juice, nutmeg and even garlic are often used to taste,
    especially in England.</p>

    <p>While Cheddar is the preferred cheese, Parmesan runs it a
    close second. Then comes Swiss. You may use any two or all
    three of these together. Sometimes Roquefort is added, as in
    the Ramekin recipes below.</p>

    <p>Such miniature Souffl&eacute;s serve as liaison officers for

    ramequins, from the French word for the small baking dish that

        tablespoonful of flour. Beat the mixture until it shrinks
        away from the sides of the saucepan; then stir in the
        grated cheese. Remove the paste thus made from the fire,
        and let it partly cool. In the meantime separate the yolks
        from the whites of three eggs, and beat them until the
        yolks foam and the whites make a stiff froth. Put the
        mixture at once into the buttered paper cases, only
        half-filling them (since they rise very high while being
        baked) with small slices of cheese, and bake in a moderate
        oven for about 15 minutes. As soon as the Puffs are done,
        put the cases on a hot dish covered with a folded napkin,
        and serve very hot.</p>

    <p>The most popular cheese for Ramekins has always been, and
    still is, Gruy&egrave;re. But because the early English also
    adopted Italian Parmesan, <!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a> that followed as a close second, and
       remains there today.</p>

    <p>Sharp Cheddar makes tangy Ramekins, as will be seen in this
    second oldster; for though it prescribes Gloucester and
    Cheshire "'arf-and-'arf," both are essentially Cheddars.
    Gloucester has been called "a glorified Cheshire" and the
    latter has long been known as a peculiarly rich and colorful
    elder brother of Cheddar, described in Kenelme Digby's
    <i>Closet Open'd</i> as a "quick, fat, rich, well-tasted
    cheese."</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Scrape fine &frac14; pound of Gloucester cheese and
        &frac14; pound of Cheshire cheese. Beat this scraped cheese
        in a mortar with the yolks of 4 eggs, &frac14; pound of
        fresh butter, and the crumbs of a French roll boiled in
        cream until soft. When all this is well mixed and pounded
        to a paste, add the beaten whites of 4 eggs. Should the
        paste seem too stiff, 1 or 2 tablespoons of sherry may be
        added. Put the paste into paper cases, and bake in a Dutch
        oven till nicely browned. The Ramekins should be served
        very hot.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since both Gloucester cheese and Cheshire cheese are not
    easily come by even in London today, it would be hard to
    reproduce this in the States. So the best we can suggest is to
    use half-and-half of two of our own great Cheddars, say
    half-Coon and half-Wisconsin Longhorn, or half-Tillamook and
    half-Herkimer County. For there's no doubt about it,
    contrasting cheeses tickle the taste buds, and as many as three
    different kinds put together make Puffs all the more
    perfect.</p>

        each pancake thickly with the mixture and roll or make into
        little pockets or envelopes with the end tucked in to hold
        the filling. Cook in foil till golden-brown and serve at

    <p>Butter and cheese are mixed together in equal parts for
    cheese butter. Serbia has a cheese called Butter that more or
    less matches Turkey's Durak, of which butter is an
    indispensable ingredient, and French Cancoillote is based on
    sour milk simmered with butter.</p>

    <p>The English have a cheese called Margarine, made with the
    butter substitute. In Westphalia there are no two schools of
    thought about whether 'tis better to eat butter with cheese or
    not, for in Westphalia sour-milk cheese, butter is mixed in as
    part of the process of making. The Arabs press curds and butter
    together to store in vats, and the Scots have Crowdie or Cruddy
    Butter.</p>

    <p>The value of buttermilk is stressed in an extravagant old
    Hindu proverb: "A man may live without bread, but without
    buttermilk he dies."</p>

    <p>Cheese was made before butter, being the earliest form of
    <!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119"
       id="Page_119"></a>dairy manufacturing, so buttermilk cheese
       came well after plain milk cheese, even after whey cheese.
       It is very tasty, and a natural with potato salad. The curd
       is salted after draining and sold in small parchment
       packages.</p>

    <p>German "leather" cheese has buttermilk mixed with the plain.
    The Danes make their Appetitost with sour buttermilk. Ricotta
    Romano, for a novelty, is made of sheep buttermilk.</p>

        COTTAGE CHEESE
    </div>

    <p>In America cottage cheese is also called pot, Dutch and
    smearcase. It is the easiest and quickest to make of all
    cheeses, by simply letting milk sour, or adding buttermilk to
    curdle it, then stand a while on the back of the kitchen stove,
    since it is homemade as a rule. It is drained in a bag of
    cheesecloth and may be eaten the same day, usually salted.</p>

    <p>The Pilgrims brought along the following two tried and true
    recipes from olde England, and both are still in use and good
    repute:</p>

    <p><i>Cottage Cheese No. 1</i></p>

    <p>Let milk sour until clotted. Pour boiling water over and it
    will immediately curd. Stir well and pour into a colander. Pour
    a little cold water on the curd, salt it and break it up
    attractively for serving.</p>

    <p><i>Cottage Cheese No. 2</i></p>

    <p>A very rich and tasty variety is made of equal parts whole
    milk and buttermilk heated together to just under the boiling
    point. Pour into a linen bag and let drain until next day. Then
    remove, salt to taste and add a bit of butter or cream to make
    a smooth, creamy consistency, and pat into balls the size of a
    Seville orange.</p>

        CREAM CHEESE
    </div>

    <p>In England there are three distinct manners of making cream
    cheese:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fresh milk strained and lightly drained.</li>

        <li>Scalded cream dried and drained dry, like
        Devonshire.</li>

        <li>Rennet curd ripened, with thin, edible rind, or none,
        packaged<br />
         in small blocks or miniature bricks by dairy companies,
        as<br />
         in the U.S. Philadelphia Cream cheese.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>American cream cheeses follow the English pattern, being
    named from then: region or established brands owned by
    Breakstone, Borden, Kraft, Shefford, etc.</p>

    <p>Cream cheese such as the first listed above is easier to
    make than cottage cheese or any other. Technically, in fact, it
    is not a cheese but the dried curd of milk and is often called
    virginal. Fresh milk is simply strained through muslin in a
    perforated box through which the whey and extra moisture drains
    away for three or four days, leaving a residue as firm as fresh
    butter.</p>

    <p>In America, where we mix cream cheese with everything, a
    popular assortment of twelve sold in New York bears these
    ingredients and names: Chives, Cherry, Garden, Caviar, Lachs,
    Pimiento, Olive and Pimiento, Pineapple, Relish, Scallion,
    Strawberry, and Triple Decker of Relish, Pimiento and Cream in
    layers.</p>

    <p>In Italy there is Stracchino Cream, in Sweden Chantilly.
    Finally, to come to France, la Fonc&eacute;e or Fromage de Pau,
    a cream also known around the world as Cr&ecirc;me d'Isigny,
    Double Cr&ecirc;me, Fromage &agrave; la Cr&ecirc;me de Gien,
    Pots de Cr&ecirc;me St. Gervais, etc. etc.</p>

    <p>The French go even farther by eating thick fresh cream with
    Chevretons du Beaujolais and Fromage Blanc in the style that
    adds <i>&agrave; la cr&ecirc;me</i> to their already glorified
    names.</p>

    <p>The English came along with Snow Cream Cheese that is more
    of a dessert, similar to Italian Cream Cheese.</p>

    <p>We'd like to have a cheese ice cream to contrast with too
    sweet ones. Attempts at this have been made, both here and in
    England; <!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a>Scottish Caledonian cream came closest. We
       have frozen cheese with fruit, to be sure, but no true
       cheese ice cream as yet, though some cream cheeses seem
       especially suitable.</p>

    <p>In this parody by Calverly, "The Farmer's Daughter," the
    ingredients suggest cheese cake, dating back to 1381 In
    England. From that year Kettner in his <i>Book of the Table</i>
    quotes this recipe:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Take cream of almonds or of cow milk and beat them well
        together; and make small coffins (that is, cases of
        pastry), and do it (put it) therein; and do (put) thereto
        sugar and good powders. Or take good fat cheese and eggs
        and make them of divers colours, green, red or yellow, and
        bake them or serve them forth.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This primitive "receipt" grew up into Richmond maids of
    honor that caused Kettner to wax poetic with:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>At Richmond we are permitted to touch with our lips a
        countless number of these maids&mdash;light and airy as the
        "airy, fairy Lilian." What more can the finest poetry
        achieve in quickening the things of earth into tokens and
        foretastes of heaven, with glimpses of higher life and
        ethereal worlds.</p>

        CHEESECAKES
    </div>

    <p><i>Coronation Cheese Cake</i></p>

    <p>The <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> defines cheese cake as a
    "tartlet filled with sweet curds, etc." This shows that the
    cheese is the main thing, and the and-so-forth just a matter of
    taste. We are delighted to record that the Lord Mayor of London
    picked traditional cheese tarts, the maids of honor mentioned
    earlier in this section, as the Coronation dessert with which
    to regale the second Queen Elizabeth at the city luncheon in
    Guildhall This is most <!-- Page 122 -->
     <a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a>fitting, since these tarts were named
       after the maids of honor at the court of the first Queen
       Elizabeth. The original recipe is said to have sold for a
       thousand pounds. These Richmond maids of honor had the usual
       cheese cake ingredients: butter and eggs and pounds of
       cheese, but what made the subtle flavor: nutmeg, brandy,
       lemon, orange-flower water, or all four?</p>

    <p>More than 2,000 years before this land of Coronation cheese
    cake, the Greeks had a word for it&mdash;several in fact:
    Apician Cheese Cake, Aristoxenean, and Philoxenean among them.
    Then the Romans took it over and we read from an epistle of the
    period:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Thirty times in this one year, Charinus, while you have
        been arranging to make your will, have I sent you cheese
        cakes dripping with Hyblaean Thyme. (Celestial honey, such
        as that of Mount Hymettus we still get from Greece.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Plato mentioned cheese cake, and a town near Thebes was
    named for it before Christ was born, at a time when cheese
    cakes were widely known as "dainty food for mortal man."</p>

    <p>Today cheese cakes come in a half dozen popular styles, of
    which the ones flavored with fresh pineapple are the most
    popular in New York. But buyers delight in every sort,
    including the one hundred percent American type called cheese
    pies.</p>

    <p>Indeed, there seems to be no dividing line between cheese
    cakes and cheese pies. While most of them are sweet, some are
    made piquant with pimientos and olives. We offer a favorite of
    ours made from popcorn-style pot cheese put through a
    sieve:</p>

        and pineapple in the order given above. Butter a square
        Pyrex pan and put in the graham-cracker dust to make,a
        crust. Cover this evenly with the pineapple and pour in the
        cheese-custard mixture. Bake I hour in a "quiet" oven, as
        the English used to say for a moderate one, and when done
        set aside for 12 hours before eating.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Because of the time and labor involved maybe you had better
    buy your cheese cakes, even though some of the truly fine ones
    cost a dime a bite, especially the pedigreed Jewish-American
    ones in Manhattan. Reuben's and Lindy's are two leaders at
    about five dollars a cake. Some are fruited with cherries or

       hot pies were baked in brick ovens and flavored with nutmeg,
       cinnamon and rose geranium. The cheese was Cheddar, but
       today all sorts of pie and cheese combinations are common,
       such as banana pie and Gorgonzola, mince with Danish Blue,
       pumpkin with cream cheese, peach pie with Habl&eacute;, and
       even a green dusting of Sapsago over raisin pie.</p>

    <p>Apple pie <i>au gratin</i>, thickly grated over with

       id="Page_126"></a> Another writer has said that "only
       gourmets among women seem to like cheese, except farm women
       and foreigners." The association between gourmets and farm
       women is borne out by the following urgent plea from early
       Italian landowners:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span><i>Ai contadini non far sapere</i><br /></span>
            <span><i>Quanta &egrave; buono it cacio con le
            pere</i>.<br /></span>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <span>Don't let the peasants know<br /></span>
            <span>How good are cheese and pears.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Having found out for ourselves, we suggest a golden slice of
    Taleggio, Stracchino, or pale gold Bel Paese to polish off a
    good dinner, with a juicy Lombardy pear or its American
    equivalent, a Bartlett, let us say.</p>

    <p>This celestial association of cheese and pears is further
    accented by the French:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span><i>Entre la poire et le fromage</i><br /></span>
            <span>Between the pear and the cheese.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This places the cheese after the fruit, as the last course,
    in accordance with early English usage set down by John Clarke
    in his <i>Paroemiologia</i>:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>After cheese comes nothing.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But in his <i>Epigrams</i> Ben Jonson serves them
    together.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will
            be.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>That brings us back to cheese and pippins:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>I will make an end of my dinner;
            there's<br /></span> <span>pippins and cheese to

            Windsor</i><br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>When should the cheese be served? In England it is served
    before or after the fruit, with or without the port.</p>

    <p>Following <i>The Book of Keruynge</i> in modern spelling we
    note when it was published in 1431 the proper thing "after
    meat" was "pears, nuts, strawberries, whortleberries (American
    huckle<!-- Page 127 -->
     <a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a>berries) and hard cheese." In modern
       practice we serve some suitable cheese like Camembert
       directly on slices of apple and pears, Gorgonzola on sliced
       banana, Habl&eacute; spread on pineapple and a cheese
       dessert tray to match the Lazy Lou, with everything crunchy
       down to Crackerjacks. Good, too, are figs, both fresh and
       preserved, stuffed with cream cheese, kumquats, avocados,
       fruity dunking mixtures of Pineapple cheese, served in the
       scooped-out casque of the cheese itself, and apple or pear
       and Provolone creamed and put back in the rind it came in.
       Pots of liquored and wined cheeses, no end, those of your
       own making being the best.</p>

    <h2>Au Gratin, Soups, Salads and Sauces</h2>

    <p>He who says <i>au gratin</i> says Parmesan. Thomas Gray, the
    English poet, saluted it two centuries ago with:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>Parma, the happy country where huge cheeses
            grow.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>On September 4, 1666, Pepys recorded the burying of his pet
    Parmesan, "as well as my wine and some other things," in a pit
    in Sir W. Batten's garden. And on the selfsame fourth of
    September, more than a century later, in 1784, Woodforde in his
    <i>Diary of a Country Parson</i> wrote:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>I sent Mr. Custance about 3 doz. more of apricots, and
        he sent me back another large piece of fine Parmesan
        cheese. It was very kind of him.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The second most popular cheese for <i>au gratin</i> is
    Italian Romano, and, for an entirely different flavor, Swiss
    Sapsago. The <!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a>French, who gave us this cookery term, use
       it in its original meaning for any dish with a browned
       topping, usually of bread crumbs, or crumbs and cheese. In
       America we think of <i>au gratin</i> as grated cheese only,
       although Webster says, "with a browned covering, often mixed
       with butter or cheese; as, potatoes <i>au gratin</i>." So
       let us begin with that.</p>

    <p><img src="images/pointer.gif"

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>2 cups diced cooked potatoes<br />
         2 tablespoons grated onion<br />

         2 tablespoons butter<br />
         &frac12; cup milk<br />
         1 egg<br />
         Salt<br />
         Pepper<br />
         More grated cheese for covering</p>

        <p>In a buttered baking dish put a layer of diced potatoes,
        sprinkle with onion and bits of butter. Next, scatter on a
        thin layer of cheese and alternate with potatoes, onions
        and butter. Stir milk, egg, salt and pepper together and
        pour it on the mixture. Top everything with plenty of
        grated cheese to make it authentically American <i>au
        gratin</i>. Bake until firm in moderate oven, about
        &frac12; hour.</p>

        over any desired number of eggs broken into a buttered
        baking dish. Begin by using half of the sauce and
        sprinkling on a lot of grated cheese. After the eggs are
        in, pour on the rest of the sauce, cover it with grated
        cheese and bread crumbs, drop in bits of butter, and cook
        until brown in oven (or about 12 minutes).</p>

        <p>Saut&eacute; onions in butter in a roomy saucepan until
        light golden, and pour the stock over. When heated put in a
        larger casserole, add the bouillon, season to taste and
        heat to boiling point. Let simmer 15 minutes and serve in
        deep well-heated soup plates, the bottoms covered with
        rounds of toasted French bread which have been heaped with
        freshly grated Parmesan and browned under the broiler. More
        cheese is served for guests to sprinkle on as desired.</p>
    </div>

    <p>At gala parties, where wine flows, a couple of glasses of
    champagne are often added to the bouillon.</p>

    <p>In the famed onion soup <i>au gratin</i> at Les Halles in
    Paris, grated Gruy&egrave;re is used in place of Parmesan. They
    are interchangeable in this recipe.</p>

        AMERICAN CHEESE SOUPS
    </div>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>In this era of fine canned soups a quick cheese soup is
        made by heating cream of tomato soup, ready made, and
        adding finely grated Swiss or Parmesan to taste. French
        bread toasted and topped with more cheese and broiled
        golden makes the best base to pour this over, as is done

        Cheddar cheese and season with salt, pepper, and plenty of
        paprika until cheese melts.</p>

        <p>Other popular American recipes simply add grated cheese
        to lima bean or split bean soup, peanut butter soup, or
        plain cheese soup with rice.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Imported French <i>marmites</i> are <i>de rigueur</i> for a
    real onion soup <i>au gratin</i>, and an imported Parmesan
    grinder might be used for freshly ground cheese. In preparing,
    it is well to remember that they are basically only melted

    <p>Often Emmentaler is cubed in a salad for breakfast, relished
    specially by males on the morning after. We quote the original
    recipe brought over by Rosie from the Swiss Tyrol to thrill the
    writers' and artists' colony of Ridgefield, New Jersey, in her
    brother Emil's White House Inn:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>First Rosie cut a thick slice of prime imported
        Emmentaler into half-inch cubes. Then she mixed imported
        French olive oil, German mustard and Swiss white wine
        vinegar with salt and freshly ground pepper in a deep soup
        plate, sprinkled on a few drops of pepper sauce scattered
        in the chunks of Schweizer and stirred the cubes with a
        light hand, using a wooden fork and spoon to prevent
        bruising.</p>

        <p>The salad was ready to eat only when each and every
        tiny, shiny cell of the Swiss from the homeland had been
        washed, oiled and polished with the soothing mixture.</p>

         Dressing</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>No cheese sauce is easier to make than the American
        favorite of Roquefort cheese mashed with a fork and mixed
        with French dressing. It is often made in a pint Mason jar
        and kept in the refrigerator to shake up on occasion and
        toss over lettuce or other salads.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unfortunately, even when the Roquefort is the French import,
    complete with the picture of the sheep in red, and <i>garanti
    v&eacute;ritable</i>, the dressing is often ruined by bad
    vinegar and cottonseed oil (of all things). When bottled to
    sell in stores, all sorts of extraneous spice, oils and mustard
    flour are used where nothing more is necessary than the
    manipulation of a fork, fine olive oil and good
    vinegar&mdash;white wine, tarragon or malt. Some ardent
    amateurs must have their splash of Worcestershire sauce or
    lemon juice with salt and pepper. This Roquefort dressing is
    good on all green salads, but on endive it's something
    special.</p>

        <p>Nothing is simpler to make. All you do is prepare a
        white sauce (the French Sauce B&eacute;chamel) and add
        grated Parmesan to your liking, stirring it in until melted

        <p>1 part of any grated cheese to 4 parts of white
        sauce</p>

        <p>This is a mild sauce that is nice with creamed or
        hard-cooked eggs. When the cheese content is doubled, 2
        parts of cheese to 4 of white sauce, it is delicious on
        boiled cauliflower, baked potatoes, macaroni and crackers
        soaked in milk.</p>

        <p>The sauce may be made richer by mixing melted butter
        with the flour in making the white sauce, or by beating egg
        yolk in with the cheese.</p>

    <p>From thin to medium to thick it serves divers purposes:</p>

    <p><i>Thin</i>: it may be used instead of milk to make a tasty

    <p><i>Medium</i>: for baking by pouring over crackers soaked in

    <p><i>Thick</i>: serves as a sort of Welsh Rabbit when poured

    <p>Since this is the Complete Book of Cheese we will fill a
    bounteous cornucopia here with more or less essential, if not
    indispensable, recipes and dishes not so easy to classify, or
    overlooked or crowded out of the main sections devoted to the
    classic Fondues, Rabbits, Souffl&eacute;s, etc.</p>

    <p><br />
     <i>Stuffed Celery, Endive, Anise and Other Suitable
    Stalks</i></p>

    <p>Use any soft cheese you like, or firm cheese softened by
    pressing through a sieve; at room temperature, of course, with
    any seasoning or relish.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>SUGGESTIONS:</p>

        <p>Cream cheese and chopped chives, pimientos, olives, or
        all three, with or without a touch of Worcestershire.</p>

        <p>Cottage cheese and piccalilli or chili sauce.</p>

        <p>Sharp Cheddar mixed with mayonnaise, mustard, cream,
        minced capers, pickles, or minced ham.</p>

        <p>Roquefort and other Blues are excellent fillings for
        your favorite vegetable stalk, or scooped-out dill pickle.
        This last is specially nice when filled with snappy cheese
        creamed with sweet butter.</p>

        <p>All canap&eacute; butters are ideally suited to stuffing
        stalks. Pineapple cheese, especially that part close to the
        pineapple-flavored rind, is perfect when creamed.</p>

        <p>A masterpiece in the line of filled stalks: Cut the
        leafy tops off an entire head of celery, endive, anise or
        anything similarly suitable. Wash and separate stalks, but
        keep them in order, to reassemble in the head after each is
        stuffed with a different mixture, using any of the above,
        or a tangy mix of your own concoction.</p>

        <p>After all stalks are filled, beginning with the baby
        center ones, press them together in the form of the
        original head, tie tight, and chill. When ready, slice in

        WITH A CHEESE SHAKER ON THE TABLE
    </div>

    <p>Italians are so dependent on cheese to enrich all their
    dishes, from soups to spaghetti&mdash;and indeed any
    vegetable&mdash;that a shaker of grated Parmesan, Romano or
    reasonable substitute stands ready at every table, or is served
    freshly grated on a side dish. Thus any Italian soup might be
    called a cheese soup, but we know of only one, the great
    minestrone, in which cheese is listed as an indispensable
    ingredient along with the pasta, peas, onion, tomatoes, kidney
    beans, celery, olive oil, garlic, oregano, potatoes, carrots,
    and so forth.</p>

    <p>Likewise, a chunk of melting or toasting cheese is essential
    in the Fritto Misto, the finest mixed grill we know, and it's
    served up as a separate tidbit with the meats.</p>

    <p>Italians grate on more cheese for seasoning than any other
    people, as the French are wont to use more wine in cooking.</p>

    <h2>Appetizers, Crackers, Sandwiches, Savories,<br />
     Snacks, Spreads and Toasts</h2>

    <p>In America cheese got its start in country stores in our
    cracker-barrel days when every man felt free to saunter in,
    pick up the cheese knife and cut himself a wedge from the
    big-bellied rattrap cheese standing under its glass bell or
    wire mesh hood that kept the flies off but not the
    free-lunchers. Cheese by itself being none too palatable, the
    taster would saunter over to the cracker barrel, shoo the cat
    off and help himself to the old-time crackers that can't be
    beat today.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145"
       id="Page_145"></a> At that time Wisconsin still belonged to
       the Indians and Vermont was our leading cheese state, with
       its Sage and Cheddar and Vermont Country Store Crackers, as
       Vrest Orton of Weston Vermont, calls them. When Orton heard
       we were writing this book, he sent samples from the store
       his father started in 1897 which is still going strong.
       Together with the Vermont Good Old-fashioned Natural Cheese
       and the Sage came a handy handmade Cracker Basket, all
       wicker, ten crackers long and just one double cracker wide.
       A snug little casket for those puffy, old-time, two-in-one
       soda biscuits that have no salt to spoil the taste of the
       accompanying cheese. Each does double duty because it's made
       to split in the middle, so you can try one kind of cheese on
       one half and another on t'other, or sandwich them
       between.</p>

    <p>Some Pied Piper took the country cheese and crackers to the
    corner saloon and led a free-lunch procession that never
    faltered till Prohibition came. The same old store cheese was
    soon pepped up as saloon cheese with a saucer of caraway seeds,
    bowls of pickles, peppers, pickled peppers and rye bread with
    plenty of mustard, pretzels or cheese straws, smearcase and
    schwarzbrot. Beer and cheese forever together, as in the
    free-lunch ditty of that great day:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>I am an Irish hunter;<br /></span> <span>I am, I

            deer<br /></span> <span>But beer.<br /></span>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It was there and then that cheese came of age from coast to
    coast. In every bar there was a choice of Swiss, Cottage,
    Limburger&mdash;manly cheeses, walkie-talkie oldsters that
    could sit up and beg, golden yellow, tangy mellow, always cut
    in cubes. <!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a>Cheese takes the cube form as naturally as
       eggs take the oval and honeycombs the hexagon.</p>

    <p>On the more elegant handout buffets, besides the shapely
    cubes, free Welsh Rabbit started at four every afternoon, to
    lead the tired businessman in by the nose; or a smear of
    Canadian Snappy out of a pure white porcelain pot in the classy
    places, on a Bent's water biscuit.</p>

        SANDWICHES AND SAVORY SNACKS
    </div>

    <p>Next to nibbling cheese with crackers and appetizers, of
    which there is no end in sight, cheese sandwiches help us
    consume most of our country's enormous output of Brick, Cheddar
    and Swiss. To attempt to classify and describe all of these
    would be impossible, so we will content ourselves by picking a
    few of the cold and hot, the plain and the fancy, the familiar
    and the exotic. Let's use the alphabet to sum up the
    situation.</p>

        slice of imported Emmentaler, well-mustarded and seasoned,
        and the usual club-sandwich toppings of thin slices of
        chicken or turkey, tomato, bacon and a lettuce leaf.</p>

    <b>B &nbsp; &nbsp; Boston Beany, Open-face</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Lightly butter a slice of Boston brown bread, cover it
        generously with hot baked beans and a thick layer of
        shredded Cheddar. Top with bacon and put under a slow
        broiler until cheese melts and the bacon crisps.</p>

           id="Page_147"></a>slice of American Cheddar well covered
           with mustard. Crimp edges of the hamburgers all around

        a cup of canned tomatoes. Season and reduce to about half.
        Fry 4 eggs and put one in the center of each of 4 pieces of
        hot toast spread with the red sauce. Sprinkle each
        generously with grated Cheddar, broil until melted and
        serve with crisp bacon.</p>

        slowly till cheese melts and the sandwich is nicely
        browned. This is a specialty of Franche-Comt&eacute;.</p>

        on both sides. Make a sandwich of these with 1 slice cooked
        chicken, &frac12; slice sharp Cheddar cheese, and a
        sprinkling of minced ham. Fasten tight with toothpicks, cut
        in half and dip thoroughly in a mixture of egg and milk.

        well-buttered but lightly mustarded rye, lay a thickish
        slab of Milwaukee K&uuml;mmelk&auml;se, which translates
        caraway cheese. For good measure sprinkle caraway seeds on
        top, or serve them in a saucer on the side. Then dash on a
        splash of k&uuml;mmel, the caraway liqueur that's best when
        imported.</p>

        <p>Marinate slices of Bermuda onion in a peppery French

        spread well with soft Limburger, top with onion and you
        will have something super-duper&mdash;if you like
        Limburger. <!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149"
           id="Page_149"></a></p>

        <p>When catsup is substituted for marinated onion the
        sandwich has quite another character and flavor, so true
        Limburger addicts make one of each and take alternate bites
        for the thrill of contrast.</p>

        slice of bread. Toast bread on one side only, spread butter
        on untoasted side, put 2 tablespoons grated cheese over
        butter, and the yolk of an egg in the center. Beat egg
        white stiff with a few grains of salt and pile lightly on
        top. Sprinkle the other 2 tablespoons of grated cheese over
        that and bake in moderate oven until the egg white is firm

    <b>O &nbsp; &nbsp; Oskar's Ham-Cam</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Oskar Davidsen of Copenhagen, whose five-foot menu lists
        186 superb sandwiches and snacks, each with a character all
        its own, perfected the Ham-Cam base for a flock of fancy
        ham sandwiches, open-faced on rye or white, soft or crisp,
        sweet or sour, almost any one-way slice you desire. He uses
        as many contrasting kinds of bread as possible, and his
        butter varies from salt to fresh and whipped. The Ham-Cam
        base involves "a juicy, tender slice of freshly boiled,
        mild-cured ham" with imported Camembert spread on the ham
        as thick as velvet.</p>

        <p><!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150"
           id="Page_150"></a> The Ham-Cam is built up with such
           splendors as "goose liver paste and Madeira wine jelly,"
           "fried calves' kidney and <i>r&eacute;moulade</i>,"
           "Bombay curry salad," "bird's liver and fried egg," "a
           slice of red roast beef" and more of that red Madeira
           jelly, with anything else you say, just so long as it
           does credit to Camembert on ham.</p>
    </div>

    <p><br />
    <b>P &nbsp; &nbsp; Pickled Camembert</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Butter a thin slice of rye or pumpernickel and spread
        with ripe imported Camembert, when in season (which isn't
        summer). Make a mixture of sweet, sour and dill pickles,
        finely chopped, and spread it on. Top this with a thin
        slice of white bread for pleasing contrast with the
        black.</p>

    <b>Q &nbsp; &nbsp; Queijo da Serra Sandwich</b></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>On generous rounds of French "flute" or other crunchy,
        crusty white bread place thick portions of any good
        Portuguese cheese made of sheep's milk "in the mountains."
        This last translates back into Queijo da Serra, the
        fattest, finest cheese in the world&mdash;on a par with
        fine Greek Feta. Bead the open-faced creamy cheese lightly
        with imported capers, and you'll say it's scrumptious.</p>

        minutes. Finish it off with chopped pine nuts, almonds, or
        a mixture thereof.</p>

        <p>Skin some juicy little, jolly little sprats, lay on thin
        rye, or a slice of miniature-loaf rye studded with caraway,

        cheese.</p>

        <p><!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151"
           id="Page_151"></a> Hickory is preferred for most of the
           smoking in America. In New York the best smoked cheese,
           whether from Canada or nearer home, is usually cured in
           the same room with sturgeon. Since this king of smoked
           fish imparts some of its regal savor to the Cheddar,
           there is a natural affinity peculiarly suited to
           sandwiching as above.</p>

        <p>Smoked salmon, eel, whitefish or any other, is also good
        with cheese smoked with hickory or anything with a
        salubrious savor, while a sandwich of smoked turkey with
        smoked cheese is out of this world. We accompany it with a

        chopped chives. And by the way, if you must use mustard on
        every cheese sandwich, try different kinds for a change:
        sharp English freshly mixed by your own hand out of the tin

        French Fromage de foin. This French hay cheese gets its
        name from being ripened on hay and holds its new-mown

        sort of century plant gives milky white <i>pulque</i>, the
        fermented juice of this cactuslike desert plant. With this
        goes a vegetable cheese curded by its own vegetable rennet.
        It's called tuna cheese, made from the milky juice of the
        prickly pear that grows on yet another cactuslike plant of
        the dry lands. This tuna cheese sometimes teams up in arid
        lands with the juicy thick cactus leaf sliced into a

        cheese, egg yolk, mustard and chopped chives, together with

        well melted and nicely gilded.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This toasted cheeser is so good it's positively sinful. The
    French, who outdo us in both cooking and sin, make one of their
    own in the form of fried fingers of stale bread doused in an
    'arf and 'arf Welsh Rabbit and Fondue melting of
    Gruy&egrave;re, that serves as a liaison to further sandwich
    the two.</p>

    <p>Garlic is often used in place of chopped chives, and in
    contrast to this wild one there's a mild one made of Dutch
    cream cheese by the equally Dutch Pennsylvanians.</p>

    <p>England, of course, together with Wales, holds all-time
    honors with such celebrated regional "toasting cheeses" as
    Devonshire and Dunlop. Even British Newfoundland is known for

    <h2>"Fit for Drink"</h2>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>A country without a fit drink for cheese has no cheese
        fit for drink.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Greece was the first country to prove its epicurean fitness,
    according to the old saying above, for it had wine to tipple
    and sheep's milk cheese to nibble. The classical Greek cheese
    has always been Feta, and no doubt this was the kind that Circe
    combined most suitably with wine to make a farewell drink for
    her lovers. She put further sweetness and body into the stirrup
    cup by stirring honey and barley meal into it. Today we might
    whip this up in an electric mixer to toast her memory.</p>

    <p>While a land flowing with milk and honey is the ideal of
    many, France, Italy, Spain or Portugal, flowing with wine and
    honey, suit a lot of gourmets better. Indeed, in such
    vinous-caseous places cheese is on the house at all wine sales
    for prospective customers to snack upon and thus bring out the
    full flavor of the <!-- Page 155 --><a name="Page_155"
       id="Page_155"></a>cellared vintages. But professional wine
       tasters are forbidden any cheese between sips. They may
       clear their palates with plain bread, but nary a crumb of
       Roquefort or cube of Gruy&egrave;re in working hours, lest
       it give the wine a spurious nobility.</p>

    <p>And, speaking of Roquefort, Roman&eacute;e has the closest
    affinity for it. Such affinities are also found in Pont
    l'Ev&ecirc;que and Beaujolais, Brie and red champagne,
    Coulommiers and any good <i>vin ros&eacute;</i>. Heavenly
    marriages are made in Burgundy between red and white wines of
    both C&ocirc;tes, de Nuits and de Baune, and Burgundian cheeses
    such as Epoisses, Soumaintarin and Saint-Florentin. Pommard and
    Port-Salut seem to be made for each other, as do Ch&acirc;teau
    Margaux and Camembert.</p>

    <p>A great cheese for a great wine is the rule that brings
    together in the neighboring provinces such notables as Sainte
    Maure, Valen&ccedil;ay, Vend&ocirc;me and the Loire
    wines&mdash;Vouvray, Saumur and Anjou. Gruy&egrave;re mates
    with Chablis, Camembert with St. Emilion; and any dry red wine,
    most commonly claret, is a fit drink for the hundreds of other
    fine French cheeses.</p>

    <p>Every country has such happy marriages, an Italian standard
    being Provolone and Chianti. Then there is a most unusual pair,
    French Neufch&acirc;tel cheese and Swiss Neuch&acirc;tel wine
    from just across the border. Switzerland also has another
    cheese favorite at home&mdash;Trauben (grape cheese), named
    from the Neuch&acirc;tel wine in which it is aged.</p>

    <p>One kind of French Neufch&acirc;tel cheese, Bondon, is also
    uniquely suited to the company of any good wine because it is
    made in the exact shape and size of a wine barrel bung. A
    similar relation is found in Brinzas (or Brindzas) that are
    packed in miniature wine barrels, strongly suggesting what
    should be drunk with such excellent cheeses: Hungarian Tokay.
    Other foreign cheeses go to market wrapped in vine leaves. The
    affinity has clearly been laid down in heaven.</p>

    <p>Only the English seem to have a <i>fortissimo</i> taste in
    the go-with wines, according to these matches registered by
    Andr&eacute; Simon in <i>The Art of Good Living:</i></p>

    <p><!-- Page 156 --><a name="Page_156"

        Red Cheshire with Light Tawny Port<br />
         White Cheshire with Oloroso Sherry<br />
         Blue Leicester with Old Vintage Port<br />
         Green Roquefort with New Vintage Port
    </div>

    <p>To these we might add brittle chips of Greek Casere with
    nips of Amontillado, for an eloquent appetizer.</p>

    <p>The English also pour port into Stilton, and sundry other
    wines and liquors into Cheddars and such. This doctoring leads
    to fraudulent imitation, however, for either port or stout is
    put into counterfeit Cheshire cheese to make up for the
    richness it lacks.</p>

    <p>While some combinations of cheeses and wines may turn out
    palatable, we prefer taking ours straight. When something more
    fiery is needed we can twirl the flecks of pure gold in a
    chalice of Eau de Vie de Danzig and nibble on legitimate Danzig
    cheese unadulterated. <i>Goldwasser</i>, or Eau de Vie, was a
    favorite liqueur of cheese-loving Franklin Roosevelt, and we
    can be sure he took the two separately.</p>

    <p>Another perfect combination, if you can take it, is imported
    k&uuml;mmel with any caraway-seeded cheese, or cream cheese
    with a handy saucer of caraway seeds. In the section of France
    devoted to gin, the juniper berries that flavor the drink also
    go into a local cheese, Fromage Fort. This is further fortified
    with brandy, white wine and pepper. One regional tipple with
    such brutally strong cheese is black coffee laced with gin.</p>

    <p>French la Jonch&eacute;e is another potted thriller with not
    only coffee and rum mixed in during the making, but orange
    flower water, too. Then there is la Petafina, made with brandy
    and absinthe; Hazebrook with brandy alone; and la Cachat with
    white wine and brandy.</p>

    <p>In Italy white Gorgonzola is also put up in crocks with
    brandy. In Oporto the sharp cheese of that name is enlivened by
    port, Cider and the greatest of applejacks, Calvados, seem made
    to go the regional Calvados cheese. This is also true of our
    native Jersey Lightning and hard cider with their accompanying
    New <!-- Page 157 --><a name="Page_157"
       id="Page_157"></a>York State cheese. In the Auge Valley of
       France, farmers also drink homemade cider with their own
       Augelot, a piquant kind of Pont l'Ev&ecirc;que.</p>

    <p>The English sip pear cider (perry) with almost any British
    cheese. Milk would seem to be redundant, but Sage cheese and
    buttermilk do go well together.</p>

    <p>Wine and cheese have other things in common. Some wines and
    some cheeses are aged in caves, and there are vintage cheeses
    no less than vintage wines, as is the case with Stilton.</p>

    <h2>Lazy Lou</h2>

    <p>Once, so goes the sad story, there was a cheesemonger
    unworthy of his heritage. He exported a shipload of inferior
    "Swiss" made somewhere in the U.S.A. Bad to begin with, it had
    worsened on the voyage. Rejected by the health authorities on
    the other side, it was shipped back, reaching home in the
    unhappy condition known as "cracked." To cut his losses the
    rascally cheesemonger had his cargo ground up and its flavor
    disguised with hot peppers and chili sauce. Thus there came
    into being the abortion known as the "cheese spread."</p>

    <p>The cheese spread or "food" and its cousin, the processed
    cheese, are handy, cheap and nasty. They are available every
    <!-- Page 159 -->
     <a name="Page_159"
       id="Page_159"></a>where and some people even like them. So
       any cheese book is bound to take formal notice of their
       existence. I have done so&mdash;and now, an unfond farewell
       to them.</p>

    <p>My academic cheese education began at the University of
    Wisconsin in 1904. I grew up with our great Midwest industry; I
    have read with profit hundreds of pamphlets put out by the
    learned Aggies of my Alma Mater. Mostly they treat of honest,
    natural cheeses: the making, keeping and enjoying of authentic
    Longhorn Cheddars, short Bricks and naturalized Limburgers.</p>

    <p>At the School of Agriculture the students still, I am told,
    keep their hand in by studying the classical layout on a cheese
    board. One booklet recommends the following for freshman
    contemplation:</p>

    <div class="center">
        <table summary="cheese board layout"
               cellpadding="4">
            <tr>
                <td align="left">CARAWAY BRICK</td>

                <td align="left">SELECT BRICK</td>

                <td align="left">EDAM</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td align="left">WISCONSIN SWISS</td>

                <td align="left">LONGHORN AMERICAN</td>

                <td align="left">SHEFFORD</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>These six sturdy samples of Wisconsin's best will stimulate
    any amount of classroom discussion. Does the Edam go better
    with German-American black bread or with Swedish Ry-Krisp? To
    butter or not to butter? And if to butter, with which cheese?
    Salt or sweet? How close do we come to the excellence of the
    genuine Alpine Swiss? Primary school stuff, but not unworthy of
    thought.</p>

    <p>Pass on down the years. You are now ready to graduate. Your
    cheese board can stand a more sophisticated setup. Try two
    boards; play the teams against each other.</p>

    <p>The postgraduate may play the game using as counters the
    great and distinctive cheeses of more than fifty countries.
    Your Scandinavian board alone, just to give an idea of the
    riches available, will shine with blues, yellows, whites, smoky
    browns, and chocolates representing Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
    Finland, Iceland and Lapland.</p>

    <p>For the Britisher only blue-veined Stilton is worthy to
    crown the banquet. The Frenchman defends Roquefort, the Dane
    his own regal Blue; the Swiss sticks to Emmentaler before,
    during and after all three meals. You may prefer to finish with
    a delicate Brie, a smoky slice of Provolone, a bit of Baby
    Gouda, or some Liptauer Garniert, about which more later.</p>

    <p>We load them all on Lazy Lou, Lazy Susan's big twin brother,
    a giant roulette wheel of cheese, every number a winner. A
    second Lazy Lou will bear the savories and go-withs. For these
    tidbits the English have a divine genius; think of the deviled
    shrimps, smoked oysters, herring roe on toast, snips of broiled
    sausage ... But we will make do with some olives and radishes,
    a few pickles, nuts, capers. With our two trusty Lazy Lous on
    hand plus wine or beer, we can easily dispense with the mere
    dinner itself.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is an Italian night. Then Lazy Lou is happily
    burdened with imported Latticini; Incanestrato, still bearing
    the imprint of its wicker basket; Pepato, which is but
    Incanestrato peppered; Mel Fina; deep-yellow, buttery Scanno
    with its slightly burned flavor; tangy Asiago; Caciocavallo, so
    called because the the cheeses, tied in pairs and hung over a
    pole, look as though they <!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161"
       id="Page_161"></a> were sitting in a saddle&mdash;cheese on
       horseback, or "<i>cacio a cavallo</i>." Then we ring in Lazy
       Lou's first assistant, an old, silver-plated, revolving
       Florentine magnum-holder. It's designed to spin a gigantic
       flask of Chianti. The flick of a finger and the bottle is
       before you. Gently pull it down and hold your glass to the
       spout.</p>

    <p>True, imported wines and cheeses are expensive. But native
    American products and reasonably edible imitations of the real
    thing are available as substitutes. Anyway, protein for
    protein, a cheese party will cost less than a steak barbecue.
    And it can be more fun.</p>

    <p>Encourage your guests to contribute their own latest
    discoveries. One may bring along as his ticket of admission a
    Primavera from Brazil; another some cubes of an Andean
    specialty just flown in from Colombia's mountain city,
    M&eacute;rida, and still wrapped in its aromatic leaves of
    <i>Frailej&oacute;n Lanudo</i>; another a few wedges of savory
    sweet English Flower cheese, some flavored with rose petals,
    others with marigolds; another a tube of South American
    Kr&auml;uterk&auml;se.</p>

    <p>Provide your own assortment of breads and try to include
    some of those fat, flaky old-fashioned crackers that country
    stores in New England can still supply. Mustard? Sure, if
    <i>.you</i> like it. If you want to be fancy, use a tricky
    little gadget put out by the Maille condiment-makers in France
    and available here in the food specialty shops. It's a
    miniature painter's palate holding five mustards of different
    shades and flavors and two mustard paddles. The mustards, in
    proper chromatic order, are: jonquil yellow "Strong Dijon";
    "Green Herbs"; brownish "Tarragon"; golden "Ora"; crimson
    "Tomato-flavored."</p>

    <p>And, just to keep things moving, we have restored an antique
    whirling cruet-holder to deliver Worcestershire sauce, soy
    sauce, A-1, Tap Sauce and Major Grey's Chutney. Salt shakers
    and pepper mills are handy, with a big-holed tin canister
    filled with crushed red-pepper pods, chili powder,
    Hungarian-paprika and such small matters. Butter, both sweet
    and salt, is on hand, together with, saucers or bowls of curry,
    capers, chives (sliced, not <!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162"
       id="Page_162"></a>chopped), minced onion, fresh mint leaves,
       chopped pimientos, caraway, quartered lemons, parsley, fresh
       tarragon, tomato slices, red and white radishes, green and
       black olives, pearl onions and assorted nutmeats.</p>

    <p>Some years ago, when I was collaborating with my mother,
    Cora, and my wife, Rose, in writing <i>10,000 Snacks</i>
    (which, by the way, devotes nearly forty pages to cheeses), we
    staged a rather elaborate tasting party just for the three of
    us. It took a two-tiered Lazy Lou to twirl the load.</p>

    <p>The eight wedges on the top round were English and French
    samples and the lower one carried the rest, as follows:</p>

    <p>The tasting began with familiar English Cheddars, Cheshires
    and Stiltons from the top row. We had cheese knives, scoops,
    graters, scrapers and a regulation wire saw, but for this line
    of crumbly Britishers fingers were best.</p>

    <p>The Cheddar was a light, lemony-yellow, almost white, like
    our best domestic "bar cheese" of old.</p>

    <p>The Cheshire was moldy and milky, with a slightly fermented
    flavor that brought up the musty dining room of Fleet Street's
    Cheshire cheese and called for draughts of beer. The Stilton
    was strong but mellow, as high in flavor as in price.</p>

    <p>Only the rum-flavored Canadian Cheddar from Montreal (by
    courtesy English) let us down. It was done up as fancy as a
    bridegroom <!-- Page 163 --><a name="Page_163"
       id="Page_163"></a> in waxed white paper and looked as smooth
       and glossy as a gardenia. But there its beauty ended. Either
       the rum that flavored it wasn't up to much or the mixture
       hadn't been allowed to ripen naturally.</p>

    <p>The French M&uuml;nster, however, was hearty, cheery, and
    better made than most German M&uuml;nster, which at that time
    wasn't being exported much by the Nazis. The Brie was melting
    prime, the Camembert was so perfectly matured we ate every
    scrap of the crust, which can't be done with many American
    "Camemberts" or, indeed, with the dead, dry French ones sold
    out of season. Then came the Roquefort, a regal cheese we voted
    the best buy of the lot, even though it was the most expensive.
    A plump piece, pleasantly unctuous but not greasy, sharp in
    scent, stimulatingly bittersweet in taste&mdash;unbeatable.
    There is no American pretender to the Roquefort throne. Ours is
    invariably chalky and tasteless. That doesn't mean we have no
    good Blues. We have. But they are not Roquefort.</p>

    <p>The Sapsago or Kr&auml;uterk&auml;se from Switzerland (it
    has been made in the Canton of Glarus for over five hundred
    years) was the least expensive of the lot. Well-cured and dry,
    it lent itself to grating and tasted fine on an old-fashioned
    buttered soda cracker. Sapsago has its own seduction, derived
    from the clover-leaf powder with which the curd is mixed and
    which gives it its haunting flavor and spring-like sage-green
    color.</p>

    <p>Next came some truly great Swiss Gruy&egrave;re, delicately
    rich, and nutty enough to make us think of the sharp white
    wines to be drunk with it at the source.</p>

    <p>As for the Provolone, notable for the water-buffalo milk
    that makes it, there's an example of really grown-up milk.
    Perfumed as spring flowers drenched with a shower of Anjou,
    having a bouquet all its own and a trace of a winelike kick, it
    made us vow never to taste another American imitation. Only a
    smooth-cheeked, thick slab cut from a pedigreed Italian
    Provolone of medium girth, all in one piece and with no sign of
    a crack, satisfy the gourmet.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164"
       id="Page_164"></a> The second Italian classic was
       Gorgonzola, gorgeous Gorgonzola, as fruity as apples,
       peaches and pears sliced together. It smells so much like a
       ripe banana we often eat them together, plain or with the
       crumbly <i>formaggio</i> lightly forked into the fruit,
       split lengthwise.</p>

    <p>After that the Edam tasted too lipsticky, like the red-paint
    job on its rind, and the Gouda seemed only half-hearted. Both
    too obviously ready-made for commerce with nothing individual
    or custom-made about them, rolled or bounced over from Holland
    by the boat load.</p>

    <p>The Ostiepki from Czechoslovakia might have been a link of
    smoked ostrich sausage put up in the skin of its own red neck.
    In spite of its pleasing lemon-yellow interior, we couldn't
    think of any use for it except maybe crumbling thirty or forty
    cents' worth into a ten-cent bowl of bean soup. But that seemed
    like a waste of money, so we set it aside to try in tiny chunks
    on crackers as an appetizer some other day, when it might be
    more appetizing.</p>

    <p>We felt much the same about the chocolate-brown Norwegian
    Gjetost that looked like a slab of boarding-school fudge and
    which had the same cloying cling to the tongue. We were told by
    a native that our piece was entirely too young. That's what
    made it so insipid, undeveloped in texture and flavor. But the
    next piece we got turned out to be too old and decrepit, and so
    strong it would have taken a Paul Bunyan to stand up under it.
    When we complained to our expert about the shock to our
    palates, he only laughed, pointing to the nail on his little
    finger.</p>

    <p>"You should take just a little bit, like that. A pill no
    bigger than a couple of aspirins or an Alka-Seltzer. It's only
    in the morning you take it when it's old and strong like this,
    for a pick-me-up, a cure for a hangover, you know, like a
    prairie oyster well soused in Worcestershire."</p>

    <p>That made us think we might use it up to flavor a Welsh
    Rabbit, <i>instead</i> of the Worcestershire sauce, but we
    couldn't melt it with anything less than a blowtorch.</p>

    <p>To bring the party to a happy end, we went to town on the
    <!-- Page 165 --><a name="Page_165"
       id="Page_165"></a> Hungarian Liptauer, garnishing that fine,
       granulating buttery base after mixing it well with some
       cream cheese. We mixed the mixed cheese with sardine and
       tuna mashed together in a little of the oil from the can. We
       juiced it with lemon, sluiced it with bottled sauces, worked
       in the leftovers, some tarragon, mint, spicy seeds, parsley,
       capers and chives. We peppered and paprikaed it, salted and
       spiced it, then spread it thicker than butter on
       pumpernickel and went to it. <i>That's</i> Liptauer
       Garniert.</p>

    <i>fromage</i> title. Soft; sheep and sometimes goat or cow; in
    cylinders of three sizes, weighing respectively about two
    ounces, one pound, and four pounds. The smaller sizes are the
    ones most often made with mixed goat and sheep milk. The method
    of curdling without the usual animal rennet is interesting and
    unusual. The milk is warmed and curdled with vegetable rennet
    made from the flowers of a local thistle, or cardoon, which is
    used in two other Portuguese cheeses&mdash;Queijo da Cardiga
    and Queijo da Serra da Estrella&mdash;and probably in many
    others not known beyond their locale. In France la Caillebotte
    is distinguished for being clabbered with <i>chardonnette</i>,
    wild artichoke seed. In Portugal, where there isn't so much
    separating of the sheep from the goats, it takes several weeks
    for Alemtejos to ripen, depending on the lactic content and
    difference in sizes.</p>

    or Allg&auml;uer Emmentaler</b><br />
     <i>Bavaria</i></p>

    <p>Hard; Emmentaler type. The small district of Allg&auml;u
    names a mountain of cheeses almost as fabulous as our
    "Rock-candy Mountain." There are two principal kinds, vintage
    Allg&auml;uer Bergk&auml;se <!-- Page 169 -->
     <a name="Page_169"
       id="Page_169"></a>and soft Allg&auml;uer Rahmk&auml;se,
       described below. This celebrated cheese section runs through
       rich pasture lands right down and into the Swiss Valley of
       the Emme that gives the name Emmentaler to one of the
       world's greatest. So it is no wonder that Allg&auml;uer
       Bergk&auml;se can compete with the best Swiss. Before the
       Russian revolution, in fact, all vintage cheeses of
       Allg&auml;u were bought up by wealthy Russian noblemen and
       kept in their home caves in separate compartments for each
       year, as far back as the early 1900's. As with fine vintage
       wines, the price of the great years went up steadily. Such
       cheeses were shipped to their Russian owners only when the
       chief cheese-pluggers of Allg&auml;u found they had reached
       their prime.</p>

    <p><b>Allg&auml;uer Rahmk&auml;se</b><br />
     <i>Bavaria</i></p>

    <p>Full cream, similar to Romadur and Limburger, but milder
    than both. This sets a high grade for similar cheeses made in
    the Bavarian mountains, in monasteries such as Andechs. It goes
    exquisitely with the rich dark Bavarian beer. Some of it is as
    slippery as the stronger, smellier Bierk&auml;se, or the
    old-time Slipcote of England. Like so many North Europeans, it
    is often flavored with caraway. Although entirely different
    from its big brother, vintage Bergk&auml;se, Rahmk&auml;se can
    stand proudly at its side as one of the finest cheeses in
    Germany.</p>

       traditional names such as Daisies, Flats, Longhorns,
       Midgets, Picnics, Prints and Twins. The ones simply called
       Cheddars weigh about sixty pounds. All are made and pressed
       and ripened in about the same way, although they differ
       greatly in flavor and quality. They are ripened anywhere
       from two months to two years and become sharper, richer and
       more flavorsome, as well as more expensive, with the passing
       of time. <i>See</i> Cheddar states and Cheddar types in

    <p>In the lavish days of olde England Artificial Dessert Cheese
    was made by mixing <!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174"
       id="Page_174"></a> one quart of cream with two of milk and
       spiking it with powdered cinnamon, nutmeg and mace. Four
       beaten eggs were then stirred in with one-half cup of white
       vinegar and the mixture boiled to a curd. It was then poured
       into a cheesecloth and hung up to drain six to eight hours.
       When taken out of the cloth it was further flavored with
       rose water, sweetened with castor sugar, left to ripen for
       an hour or two and finally served up with more cream.</p>

    <p>While our beer cheese came from Germany and the word is

    aromatic cheese is considered by many as the very best to eat

    <p>The milk, which has been allowed to curdle spontaneously, is
    skimmed and allowed to drain. When dry it is thoroughly kneaded
    by hand and is allowed <!-- Page 181 --><a name="Page_181"
       id="Page_181"></a> to undergo fermentation, which takes
       ordinarily from ten to fourteen days in winter and six to
       eight days in summer. When the fermentation is complete,
       cream and salt are added and the mixture is heated slowly
       and stirred until homogeneous, when it is put into molds and
       allowed to ripen for eight days longer. A cheese ordinarily
       weighs about three-and-a-half pounds. It is not essentially
       different from other forms of cooked cheese.</p>

    <p><b>Bellelay, T&ecirc;te de Moine, or Monk's Head</b><br />
     <i>Switzerland</i></p>

    <p>Soft, buttery, semisharp spread. Sweet milk is coagulated
    with rennet in twenty to thirty minutes, the curd cut fairly
    fine and cooked not so firm as Emmentaler, but firmer than
    Limburger. After being pressed, the cheeses are wrapped in bark
    for a couple of weeks until they can stand alone. Since no eyes
    are desired in the cheeses, they are ripened in a moist cellar
    at a lowish temperature. They take a year to ripen and will
    keep three or four years. The diameter is seven inches, the
    weight nine to fifteen pounds. The monk's head after cutting is
    kept wrapped in a napkin soaked in white wine and the soft,
    creamy spread is scraped out to "butter" bread and snacks that
    go with more white wine. Such combinations of old wine and old
    cheese suggest monkish influence, which began here in the
    fifteenth century with the jolly friars of the Canton of Bern.
    There it is still made exclusively and not exported, for
    there's never quite enough to go around.</p>

    cheese bread called Notruschki and the cheese that flavors it
    is Tworog. (<i>See both</i>.) Only recently Schrafft's in New
    York put out a yellow, soft and toothsome cheese bread that has
    become very popular for toasting. It takes heat to bring out
    its full cheesy savor. Good when overlaid with cheese butter of
    contrasting piquance, say one mixed with Sapsago.</p>

    <p>In making this combination of Cheshire and Stilton, the blue
    mold peculiar to Stilton is introduced in the usual Cheshire
    process by keeping out each day a little of the curd and mixing
    it with that in which the mold is growing well. The result is
    the Cheshire in size and shape and general characteristics but
    with the blue veins of Stilton, making it really a Blue
    Cheddar. Another combination is Yorkshire-Stilton, and quite as
    distinguished.</p>

    customers think they are getting something from Olde England or
    some aristocratic private club. All are described as
    "tangy."</p>

    <p>Originally butter went into the better clubs which were sold

    through Ames in Iowa, Madison in Wisconsin, all across the
    continent to Cornell in New York, vie with one another in
    turning out diploma-ed American Cheddars and such of high
    degree. It is largely to the agricultural colleges that we owe
    the steady improvement in both quality and number of foreign
    imitations since the University of Wisconsin broke the curds

    <p>Named from cooking sour clabbered curd to the melting point.
    When cool it is allowed to stand three or four days until it is

    <p>All cooked cheese is apt to be tasteless unless some of the

    <p>Made in all countries where any sort of milk is obtainable.
    In America it's also called pot, Dutch, and smearcase. The
    English, who like playful names for homely dishes, call cottage
    cheese smearcase from the German Schmierk&auml;se. It is also
    called Glumse in Deutschland, and, together with cream, formed
    the basis of all of our fine Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine.</p>

    only one inch high and measuring five or six inches across. It
    is made near Paris and is a great favorite from the autumn and
    winter months, when it is made, on until May. The making starts
    in October, a month earlier than most Brie, and it is off the

    <p>Blue mold type from Dorsetshire; crumbly, sharp; made in

    as well as merely eaten.</p>

    <p><b>Drinking cheeses</b></p>

    <p>Not only Dresdener, but dozens of regional hand cheeses in
    Germanic countries are melted in steins of beer or glasses of
    wine to make distinctive cheesed drinks for strong stomachs and
    noses. This peps up the drinks in somewhat the same way as ale
    and beer are laced with pepper sauce in some parts.</p>

    <p><b>Dry</b><br />
     <i>Germany</i></p>

    <p>From the drinking cheese just above to dry cheese is quite a
    leap. "This cheese, known as Sperrk&auml;se and
    Trockenk&auml;se, is made in the small dairies of the eastern
    part of the Bavarian Alps and in the Tyrol. It is an extremely
    simple product, made for home consumption and only in the
    winter season, when the milk cannot be profitably used for
    other purposes. As soon as the milk is skimmed it is put into a
    large kettle which can be swung over a fire, where it is kept
    warm until it is thoroughly thickened from souring. It is then
    broken up and cooked quite firm. A small quantity of salt and
    sometimes some caraway seed are added, and the curd is put into
    forms of various sizes. It is then placed in a drying room,
    where it becomes very hard, when it is ready for eating." (From
    U.S. Department of Agriculture <i>Bulletin</i> No. 608.)</p>

    <p>Before our processed and food cheese era some scoundrels in

    Such adulteration killed the flavor and quality, and no doubt
    some of the customers. Luckily in America we put down this
    vicious counterfeiting with pure food laws. But such foreign
    fats are still stuffed into the skimmed milk of many foreign
    cheeses. To take the place of the natural butterfat the phony
    fats are whipped in violently and extra rennet is added to
    speed up coagulation.</p>

    <p>A general name for goat's milk cheese. Usually a small

    weighing up to a half pound. In making, the curds are set on a
    straw mat in molds, for the whey to run away. They are salted
    and turned after two days to salt the other side. They ripen in
    three weeks with a very pleasing flavor.</p>

    color all the way through is tobacco-brown and the taste, too.
    It has been compared to medicine, chewing tobacco, petrified
    Limburger, and worse. In his <i>Encyclopedia of Food</i>
    Artemas Ward says that in Gammelost the ferments absorb so much
    of the curd that "in consequence, instead of eating cheese

    distinguishes Goya from lesser Parmesan types, even back in
    Italy.</p>

    <p>It is interesting that the nitrate in Chilean soil makes

    <p>Curious because the sheep's milk that makes it is milked

    rennet added, curd broken up, whey drained off, curd put into
    forms and pressed lightly. But after that it is wrapped in
    leaves and ropes of grass. After curing two weeks in the
    leaves, they are discarded, the cheese salted and wrapped up in
    leaves again for another ripening period.</p>

    is the regional name for Brinza, as well, and it's made in the
    same manner, of sheep milk and sometimes cow. Salty and
    spready, somewhat oily, as most sheep-milkers are. A fairly
    sharp taste with a suggestion of sour milk. It is sold in

     <i>Calvados, France</i></p>

    <p>Soft paste, colored with annatto-brown or deep red (also,
    uncommonly, fresh and white). It has the advantage over
    Camembert, made in the same region, in that it may be
    manufactured during the summer months when skim milk is
    plentiful and cheap. It is formed in cylinders, six by two
    inches, and ripened several months in the even temperature of
    caves, to be eaten at its best only in January, February and
    March. By June and afterward it should be avoided. Similar to
    Mignot II. Early in the process of making, after ripening ten
    to twelve days, the cheeses are wrapped in fresh <i>laiche</i>
    leaves, both to give flavor and help hold in the ammonia and
    other essentials for making a strong, piquant Livarot.</p>

    partaken of in "religious silence." All the guests guessed, but
    none was right. So the host announced it was made of <i>"lait

    <p>M&uuml;nster is a world-wide classic that doubles for both
    German and French. G&eacute;rom&eacute; is a standard French
    type of it, with a little longer season, beginning in April,
    and a somewhat different flavor from anise seed. Often, instead
    of putting the seeds inside, a dish of caraway is served with
    the cheese for those who like to flavor to taste.</p>

    <p>An apt American name for any round store cheese that can be
    cut in wedges like a pie. Perfect with apple or mince or any
    other pie. And by the way, in these days when natural cheese is
    getting harder to find, any piece of American Cheddar cut in
    pie wedges before being wrapped in cellophane is apt to be the
    real thing&mdash;if it has the rind on. The wedge shape is
    used, however, <i>without any rind</i>, to make processed
    pastes pass for "natural" even without that identifying word,
    and with misleading labels such as old, sharp Cheddar and "aged
    nine months." That's long enough to make a baby, but not a
    "natural" out of a processed "Cheddar."</p>

    <p>Made in Thuringia from sour cow milk with sheep or goat
    sometimes added. "The potatoes are boiled and grated or mashed.
    One part of the potato is thoroughly mixed or kneaded with two
    or three parts of die curd. In the better cheese three parts of
    potatoes are mixed with two of curd. During the mixing, salt
    and sometimes caraway seed are added. The cheese is allowed to
    stand for from two to four days while a fermentation takes
    place. After this the curd is sometimes covered with beer or
    cream and is finally placed in tubs and allowed to ripen for
    fourteen days. A variety of this cheese is made in the U.S. It
    is probable, however, that it is not allowed to ripen for quite
    so long a period as the potato cheese of Europe. In all other

    <p><b>Rush Cream Cheese</b><br />
     <i>England and France</i></p>

    <p>Not named from the rush in which many of our cheeses are
    made, but from the rush mats and nets some fresh cream cheeses
    are wrapped and sewed up in to ripen. According to an old
    English recipe the curds are collected with an ordinary
    fish-slice and placed in a rush shape, covered with a cloth
    when filled. Lay a half-pound weight in a saucer and set this
    on top of the strained curd for a few hours, and then increase
    the weight by about a half pound. Change the cloths daily until
    the cheese looks mellow, then put into the rush shape with the
    fish slice. The formula in use in France, where willow
    heart-shape baskets are sold for making this cheese, is as
    follows: Add one cup new warm milk to two cups freshly-skimmed
    cream. Dissolve in this one teaspoon of fine sugar and one
    tablespoon common rennet or thirty drops of Hauser's extract of
    rennet. Let it remain in a warm place until curd sets. Rush and
    straw mats are easily made by cutting the straw into lengths
    and stringing them with a needle and thread. The mats or
    baskets should not be used a second time.</p>

    known as Hartk&auml;se, Reibk&auml;se and Wallisk&auml;se, it
    came to fame in the sixteenth century and has always fetched an
    extra price for its quality and age. It is cooked much dryer in
    the making, so it takes longer to ripen and then keeps longer
    than any other. It weighs only ten to twenty pounds and the

    <p>Many a bland cheese is saved from oblivion by the addition
    of spice, to give it zest. One or more spices are added in the
    making and thoroughly mixed with the finished product, so the
    cheese often takes the name of the spice: Kuminost
    <!-- Page 297 --><a name="Page_297"
       id="Page_297"></a> or Kommenost for cumin; Caraway in
       English and several other languages, among them K&uuml;mmel,

    <p><b>Welsh cheeses</b></p>

    <p>The words Welsh and cheese have become synonyms down the
    ages. Welsh "cheeses can be attractive: the pale, mild
    Caerphilly was famous at one time, and nowadays has usually a
    factory flavor. A soft cream cheese can be obtained at some
    farms, and sometimes holds the same delicate melting
    sensuousness <!-- Page 311 --><a name="Page_311"
       id="Page_311"></a>that is found in the poems of John
       Keats.</p>

    <p>"The 'Resurrection Cheese' of Llanfihangel Abercowyn is no
    longer available, at least under that name. This cheese was so
    called because it was pressed by gravestones taken from an old
    church that had fallen into ruins. Often enough the cheeses
    would be inscribed with such wording as 'Here lies Blodwen
    Evans, aged 72.'" (From <i>My Wales</i> by Rhys Davies.)</p>

    season from June to September. It is put up in the same
    cylindrical form as Stilton, but smaller. The rind is
    corrugated from the way the wrapping is put on.</p>

       Brioler</b><br />
     <i>Germany</i></p>

    <p>Sour-milk hand cheese, kneaded by hand. Butter and/or egg
    yolk is mixed in with salt, and either pepper or caraway seeds.
    Then the richly colored curd is shaped by hand into small balls
    or rolls of about one pound. It is dried for a couple of hours
    before being put down cellar to ripen. The peculiar flavor is
    due partly to the seasonings and partly to the curd being
    allowed to putrify a little, like Limburger, before
    pressing.</p>

    <p>This sour-milker is as celebrated as Westphalian raw ham. It
    is so soft and fat it makes a sumptuous spread, similar to
    Tilsit and Brinza. It was named Brioler from the "Gute Brioler"
    inn where it was perfected by the owner, Frau Westphal, well
    over a century ago.</p>

    <p><b>Wisconsin Factory Cheeses</b><br />
     <i>U.S.A.</i></p>

    <p>Have the date of manufacture stamped on the rind, indicating
    by the age whether the flavor is "mild, mellow, nippy, or
    sharp." American Cheddar requires from eight months to a year
    to ripen properly, but most of it is sold green when far too
    young.</p>

    Swiss.</p>

    <p><b>Withania</b><br />
     <i>India</i></p>

    <p>Cow taboos affect the cheesemaking in India, and in place of

    berries. This names a cheese of agreeable flavor when ripened,
    but, unfortunately, it becomes acrid with age.</p>

    <hr style="width: 75%;" />

    <p>Bob Brown, after living thirty years in as many foreign
    lands and enjoying countless national cheeses at the source,
    returned to New York and summed them all up in this book.</p>

    <p>Born in Chicago, he was graduated from Oak Park High School
    and entered the University of Wisconsin at the exact moment
    when a number of imported Swiss professors in this great dairy
    state began teaching their students how to hole an
    Emmentaler.</p>

    <p>After majoring in beer and free lunch from Milwaukee to
    Munich, Bob celebrated the end of Prohibition with a book
    called <i>Let There Be Beer!</i> and then decided to write
    another about Beer's best friend, Cheese. But first he
    collaborated with his mother Cora and wife Rose on <i>The Wine
    Cookbook</i>, still in print after nearly twenty-five years.
    This first manual on the subject in America paced a baker's
    dozen food-and-drink books, including: <i>America Cooks, 10,000
    Snacks, Fish and Seafood</i> and <i>The South American
    Cookbook</i>.</p>

    <p>For ten years he published his own weekly magazines in Rio
    de Janeiro, Mexico City and London. In the decade before that,
    from 1907 to 1917, he wrote more than a thousand short stories
    and serials under his full name, Robert Carlton Brown. One of
    his first books, <i>What Happened to Mary</i>, became a best
    seller and was the first five-reel movie. This put him in
    <i>Who's Who</i> in his early twenties.</p>

    <p>In 1928 he retired to write and travel. After a couple of
    years spent in collecting books and bibelots throughout
    <!-- Page 321 --><a name="Page_321"
       id="Page_321"></a> the Orient, he settled down in Paris with
       the expatriate group of Americans and invented the Reading
       Machine for their delectation. Nancy Cunard published his
       <i>Words</i> and Harry Crosby printed <i>1450-1950</i> at
       the Black Sun Press, while in Cagnes-sur-Mer Bob had his own
       imprint Roving Eye Press, that turned out <i>Demonics; Gems,
       a Censored Anthology; Globe-gliding</i> and <i>Readies for
       Bob Brown's Machine</i> with contributions by Gertrude
       Stein, Ezra Pound, Kay Boyle, James T. Farrell <i>et
       al.</i></p>

    <p>The depression drove him back to New York, but a decade
    later he returned to Brazil that had long been his home away
    from home. There he wrote <i>The Amazing Amazon</i>, with his
    wife Rose, making a total of thirty books bearing his name.</p>

    <p>After the death of his wife and mother, Bob Brown closed
    their mountain home in Petropolis, Brazil, and returned to New
    York where he remarried and now lives, in the Greenwich Village
    of his free-lancing youth. With him came the family's working
    library in a score of trunks and boxes, that formed the basis
    of a mail-order book business in which he specializes today in
    food, drink and other out-of-the-way items.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
